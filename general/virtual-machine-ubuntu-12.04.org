#+STARTUP: showall
* Introduction / Purpose

This is the beginnings of my second attempt to build a workhorse VM
for geospatial science types.  My first attempt was build from Ubuntu 
11.04 on VMWare Fusion 3.  I hope this one will do better as it is
built on 12.04 LTS (Long Term Support) and I gained at least some
experience from the first iteration.  That first time around, I was
under the gun to have something ready for the first day of class.
At that point, I had to freeze what I was doing.  Changing the virtual
machine out from under the students when I was just starting to
understand the implications myself was going to be a recipe for disaster.

Iteration 2 is being done with several goals in mind:

- a learning environment
- a safe place for me to try lots of techniques and libraries
- show others how I set things up - Let them built all or part
  themselves.
- figure out how to shrink this better and build live DVD/USB releases
- a virtual machine that you could use while at sea *without internet*
- possibly a virtual machine that CCOM could deploy to students and
  researchers that need a linux like environment on their Windows PCs
  and Macs.

There are a number of linux distributions available that match this
already, but with my idea of building up a puppet or chef build up, I
think I might have something that is a little more transparent and
flexible.  I wish Poseidon had their "how did we do it" right up front.

I don't want to be a distribution, but more a collection of knowledge
on how to get what you might want and how to use it to study the
outside world.

* Rough specs

- Based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- 64-bit desktop
- Built using VMWare Fusion 4

* TODO Ideas 

- Can I use a configuration management system to script the zero to
  full blown system?  http://bhuga.net/puppet-vs-chef

  - http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet
  - Probably not: http://www.gnu.org/software/cfengine/
