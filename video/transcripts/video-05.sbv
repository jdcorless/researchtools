0:00:03.050,0:00:07.580
hello my name is courage where and
welcome to video five for research tools

0:00:07.580,0:00:10.840
at the university of new hampshire
center for coastal ocean mapping

0:00:10.840,0:00:12.469
trying graphic center

0:00:12.469,0:00:16.890
in his video i will be showing you a
tutorial of using the yugo into bash

0:00:16.890,0:00:19.099
terminal

0:00:19.099,0:00:23.029
this is an environment that is all tax
base where we can type

0:00:23.029,0:00:24.840
who want to use the mouse at all

0:00:24.840,0:00:27.450
i'm going to go through and run commands
that will let us

0:00:27.450,0:00:30.140
creative all sorts of tasks handle them

0:00:30.140,0:00:34.410
and then figure out how we can put them
into a script at the end

0:00:34.410,0:00:37.409
now michigan basics of moving around to
the terminal

0:00:37.409,0:00:38.420
and uh... it

0:00:38.420,0:00:43.060
first commanding the show you is l_s_
four list useless files you can also

0:00:43.060,0:00:44.519
give hip-hop shins

0:00:44.519,0:00:47.600
if you do along listing with a dash home

0:00:47.600,0:00:49.449
and i will tell you more information

0:00:49.449,0:00:50.600
in this case

0:00:50.600,0:00:53.920
you can see anti for directory

0:00:53.920,0:00:56.680
car w x for rewrite execute

0:00:56.680,0:00:58.540
greed and execute

0:00:58.540,0:01:01.570
so you can take a look at each of your
things here the color on the right will

0:01:01.570,0:01:02.320
help

0:01:02.320,0:01:03.890
give you can store ads

0:01:03.890,0:01:06.869
this high profile so we have to retreat
here at bloom

0:01:06.869,0:01:07.800
and

0:01:07.800,0:01:11.980
and archive of multiple files here and
ready

0:01:11.980,0:01:14.170
we can also ask the system

0:01:14.170,0:01:17.860
where are we pick a bureaucrat working
directory

0:01:17.860,0:01:21.600
and that tells us they were in home
research tools and in this case freezing

0:01:21.600,0:01:24.550
account called research tools

0:01:24.550,0:01:28.830
you can do a cd so we can cv into
homework

0:01:28.830,0:01:31.570
and you can write how us with change
directory

0:01:31.570,0:01:34.860
into another draft folder or directory
below that

0:01:34.860,0:01:38.660
and then you can say pvd on our talents
that were

0:01:38.660,0:01:40.380
down below and

0:01:40.380,0:01:41.640
uh... the homework retreat

0:01:41.640,0:01:44.259
there's two ways to get back we can do
cd

0:01:44.259,0:01:48.490
dot dot which is the parent directory
and that temperatures back here research

0:01:48.490,0:01:49.659
tools

0:01:49.659,0:01:52.040
or we can if we go back in the homework

0:01:52.040,0:01:53.879
and reviewed cd filled up

0:01:53.879,0:01:57.620
have always take your

0:01:57.620,0:02:00.399
right let's go ahead and create a quick
file so we can type

0:02:00.399,0:02:04.079
touch this is going to create an empty
file or if the file are just two oldest

0:02:04.079,0:02:05.530
update i'm on it

0:02:05.530,0:02:09.919
golden touch one two and three now if we
take a look we've created

0:02:09.919,0:02:14.699
three files called one two and three
this calmer here it is the file size and

0:02:14.699,0:02:16.180
you can see that's

0:02:16.180,0:02:18.959
zero bytes

0:02:18.959,0:02:23.260
i'm free point to create retreat we
could say make it d i heart for make

0:02:23.260,0:02:24.869
directory

0:02:24.869,0:02:27.039
and we'll see past

0:02:27.039,0:02:29.199
directory

0:02:29.199,0:02:31.059
enough to do tell us that show

0:02:31.059,0:02:32.499
we know at the bottom half

0:02:32.499,0:02:35.279
test directory

0:02:35.279,0:02:38.119
now is important to know how to be able
to clean up after self

0:02:38.119,0:02:42.109
each very careful with the army command
to camille hard to undo the files that

0:02:42.109,0:02:45.259
if you have no backup system they may be
gone forever

0:02:45.259,0:02:48.209
return file secure the commanders our
agm

0:02:48.209,0:02:49.139
and

0:02:49.139,0:02:51.199
farm into arms one

0:02:51.199,0:02:54.120
and in this case i have it set up so
that it will actually asked a question

0:02:54.120,0:02:55.309
yes or no

0:02:55.309,0:02:57.709
for will likely not have that

0:02:57.709,0:03:00.400
so depressed wire say yes

0:03:00.400,0:03:04.219
or we can to lead to files from the
scene command-line figures two and three

0:03:04.219,0:03:06.129
are in

0:03:06.129,0:03:07.889
and yes

0:03:07.889,0:03:11.649
now for trip are immature treats her or
in dash

0:03:11.649,0:03:13.240
also at the command shell

0:03:13.240,0:03:14.959
if you're probably through and

0:03:14.959,0:03:17.290
there's one unique injury too much press
tab

0:03:17.290,0:03:20.539
to complete down

0:03:20.539,0:03:24.019
sify tree pollen tests retrieved a
complaint saying that it's the directory

0:03:24.019,0:03:26.419
or informing her of his finals

0:03:26.419,0:03:29.399
so we can do r_ and d_ a_ r_

0:03:29.399,0:03:30.369
press tab

0:03:30.369,0:03:32.329
directory

0:03:32.329,0:03:33.409
enough to take a look

0:03:33.409,0:03:36.329
we've cleaned up after assaults

0:03:36.329,0:03:38.699
you can also ask the system what time
was it

0:03:38.699,0:03:42.509
and if you can do that by taking date

0:03:42.509,0:03:44.879
ninety minutes before appear

0:03:44.879,0:03:50.209
our files timestamp uh... too a m that's
not correct me too a m

0:03:50.209,0:03:53.419
so we need to asses the sand update the
times uh... virtual machine if it's been

0:03:53.419,0:03:56.689
asleep it may not be able to get the
time right

0:03:56.689,0:04:01.179
and making the casket with time with the
economy can go and check make sure it's

0:04:01.179,0:04:02.549
to date so

0:04:02.549,0:04:06.830
ceos the commandment lots of speak on
basically recordings trader

0:04:06.830,0:04:08.709
and get extra privileges

0:04:08.709,0:04:10.649
seventy p date

0:04:10.649,0:04:13.659
is the commander dick time and then we
need to ask it

0:04:13.659,0:04:17.519
is gonna wanna know which host to go get
the time from

0:04:17.519,0:04:20.979
so the folks that you're going to
provide it i'm sure that we can ask

0:04:20.979,0:04:23.280
and so i asked her to read gps data

0:04:23.280,0:04:27.710
and go off to the ante p server at you
going to end at the time

0:04:27.710,0:04:31.280
tonight at my password and since this is
the first machine i will tell you my

0:04:31.280,0:04:32.199
password

0:04:32.199,0:04:33.969
isn't xmission point

0:04:33.969,0:04:35.330
party

0:04:35.330,0:04:36.900
two thousand eleven

0:04:36.900,0:04:39.600
the m presenter

0:04:39.600,0:04:42.179
and now it's off working to set the time

0:04:42.179,0:04:43.800
working working

0:04:43.800,0:04:45.719
this might take awhile depending on

0:04:45.719,0:04:49.019
what all has to do the network and you
can see here that is change the time

0:04:49.019,0:04:50.180
quite a bit

0:04:50.180,0:04:52.240
the offset was quite large

0:04:52.240,0:04:55.909
snapper type date again and actually
says that it's ten in the morning which

0:04:55.909,0:04:59.909
is much more reasonable

0:04:59.909,0:05:00.919
if u

0:05:00.919,0:05:04.270
get confused by having too much stuff on
the screen we can always run the clear

0:05:04.270,0:05:06.030
command that bold

0:05:06.030,0:05:09.239
fully everything that's currently on our
screen presenter

0:05:09.239,0:05:12.769
and clear has cleared the screen

0:05:12.769,0:05:13.810
okay so

0:05:13.810,0:05:16.630
that's giving the basics of moving
around a little it we've done our l_s_

0:05:16.630,0:05:18.669
four list

0:05:18.669,0:05:21.160
print working directly with people be
deep

0:05:21.160,0:05:22.470
c_d_-four

0:05:22.470,0:05:24.159
accused iraq to read

0:05:24.159,0:05:29.479
touch to create a file orchid time and
katie i or for make directory

0:05:29.479,0:05:32.810
korean for delete a file

0:05:32.810,0:05:36.129
are endure for doing directories

0:05:36.129,0:05:38.389
let's find out more about some news
program then

0:05:38.389,0:05:39.590
built into

0:05:39.590,0:05:43.640
one x carvings called main pages so with
the system comes a whole lot of

0:05:43.640,0:05:45.949
documentation when you get to that
through that

0:05:45.949,0:05:47.719
program called me on

0:05:47.719,0:05:49.330
so if you may end

0:05:49.330,0:05:52.139
allowance for was coming and

0:05:52.139,0:05:53.240
and press enter

0:05:53.240,0:05:54.819
it now brings you into you

0:05:54.819,0:05:58.750
them and page for ls make a move down
with the air peas

0:05:58.750,0:06:00.599
if we are working hard for him

0:06:00.599,0:06:05.490
you can suppress space to go down by
page

0:06:05.490,0:06:09.439
if you need to gather secret press queue
for quit

0:06:09.439,0:06:11.479
rescue ok sore back there

0:06:11.479,0:06:12.800
now we can save

0:06:12.800,0:06:14.050
man

0:06:14.050,0:06:15.189
dash k

0:06:15.189,0:06:20.909
and give their option options they say
we want to know about

0:06:20.909,0:06:23.150
with some wording themself we take

0:06:23.150,0:06:25.169
take uh...

0:06:25.169,0:06:26.650
clean desk at length

0:06:26.650,0:06:28.119
it's then going to tell us

0:06:28.119,0:06:30.009
what things

0:06:30.009,0:06:32.919
ham and pages with a name life in them

0:06:32.919,0:06:35.270
so there's a whole bunch of different
things on here

0:06:35.270,0:06:37.529
if you see a number to in there

0:06:37.529,0:06:39.150
that will be

0:06:39.150,0:06:40.090
uh...

0:06:40.090,0:06:41.430
four system

0:06:41.430,0:06:44.590
calls this is a c programming language
thing you can ignore

0:06:44.590,0:06:48.419
and number three dozen other c
programming language that you can ignore

0:06:48.419,0:06:50.340
you also seen mandated for

0:06:50.340,0:06:54.029
the permanent which parole and lots of
other stuff hiding here

0:06:54.029,0:06:56.849
so if you're searching for something men

0:06:56.849,0:06:59.219
dash cayenne

0:06:59.219,0:07:01.110
conspicuously max

0:07:01.110,0:07:04.919
so this will actually go out there and
search for it to hear some programs that

0:07:04.919,0:07:05.599
have

0:07:05.599,0:07:08.440
email acts in their one mine descriptor

0:07:08.440,0:07:12.410
severe example here is some program
called c tags that you could use

0:07:12.410,0:07:14.929
that heaven and paid to protect me and

0:07:14.929,0:07:16.349
c tags

0:07:16.349,0:07:18.610
it's now been tells all about that
program

0:07:18.610,0:07:22.639
you can take your time and read all out

0:07:22.639,0:07:25.329
and that was actually using up program
called the pager

0:07:25.329,0:07:28.520
called lance

0:07:28.520,0:07:30.060
begin our special

0:07:30.060,0:07:31.979
i have an example to retire

0:07:31.979,0:07:34.769
tar file here which is called the tape
archive

0:07:34.769,0:07:37.659
is very similar to a zip on windows

0:07:37.659,0:07:40.289
but it predates is it by quite a bit and
it's

0:07:40.289,0:07:41.080
in my opinion

0:07:41.080,0:07:44.370
much more user-friendly for unix type

0:07:44.370,0:07:47.649
so let's take a look at what's in that
car

0:07:47.649,0:07:49.219
said ta aren't

0:07:49.219,0:07:51.509
and then t f is

0:07:51.509,0:07:52.349
list

0:07:52.349,0:07:55.619
for his t for some reason antacids file

0:07:55.619,0:07:58.609
through analyst puts in their examples

0:07:58.609,0:08:02.069
dot two thousand level in the press
pound complete

0:08:02.069,0:08:04.969
to know if you take a look what's in
that part of a whole bunch of the sample

0:08:04.969,0:08:06.610
files that we can use to it

0:08:06.610,0:08:09.099
to try it more comments

0:08:09.099,0:08:13.069
savannah do at the uparrow to get your
previous command

0:08:13.069,0:08:14.430
and bring to you and

0:08:14.430,0:08:18.560
acts for extra racked and you'll have to
be at the end wanda presenter something

0:08:18.560,0:08:20.129
to read here

0:08:20.129,0:08:24.340
and it went off and extracted and so
let's do it i wants dash aol

0:08:24.340,0:08:25.769
prolong listing

0:08:25.769,0:08:28.879
and you now see that condition to the
tape archive

0:08:28.879,0:08:31.029
there's actually a director to go with
it

0:08:31.029,0:08:35.940
let's go into that directory with the cd
commands for change directory

0:08:35.940,0:08:38.250
with cd into examples

0:08:38.250,0:08:41.029
pvdf working directory and here we are

0:08:41.029,0:08:43.960
so now we can do and i watched that show

0:08:43.960,0:08:45.760
and take a look around

0:08:45.760,0:08:48.190
so as a whole bunch of sample files that
i have

0:08:48.190,0:08:49.459
create here in this

0:08:49.459,0:08:50.530
little package

0:08:50.530,0:08:55.020
to help trial lots of different commands

0:08:55.020,0:08:58.030
one thing that we've got here is uh...

0:08:58.030,0:09:01.490
loop government comes word order in
terms of files clones bear

0:09:01.490,0:09:04.050
missus file size in the middle

0:09:04.050,0:09:07.880
we'd like to have say haven't supported
by fall scientists looking for that

0:09:07.880,0:09:09.250
he adam pass

0:09:09.250,0:09:11.550
capitalise on that

0:09:11.550,0:09:12.600
helen's

0:09:12.600,0:09:14.620
and that's been supported by

0:09:14.620,0:09:17.500
filesize with decreasing at the bottom

0:09:17.500,0:09:22.380
city for example we have a small program
called shell script dot s_h_ that we can

0:09:22.380,0:09:24.170
take a look at

0:09:24.170,0:09:26.500
enemies that clean coal lots

0:09:26.500,0:09:29.620
amarillo take a look at celeste shell

0:09:29.620,0:09:30.579
script

0:09:30.579,0:09:35.280
s_h_ have pressed ham right here after
the s_ h_

0:09:35.280,0:09:38.550
now for presenter worry a pager that's
very similar

0:09:38.550,0:09:42.030
to down main page

0:09:42.030,0:09:43.050
and with that

0:09:43.050,0:09:47.720
it's not very interested in terms of
short walk karke

0:09:47.720,0:09:51.590
but if this were a longer file and we
can take a look at

0:09:51.590,0:09:55.010
uh... say let's look at pat

0:09:55.010,0:09:56.720
um... delicious

0:09:56.720,0:10:00.080
packaged him this is a huge team alfono

0:10:00.080,0:10:01.670
this one is a lot longer

0:10:01.670,0:10:04.590
and we can scroll down to that files for
a backup

0:10:04.590,0:10:07.810
press spaced

0:10:07.810,0:10:10.240
okay so there's a couple other plans are
helpful

0:10:10.240,0:10:13.860
that had come in and we'll take a look
at the first time lines of uh... final

0:10:13.860,0:10:17.020
so we can say hey

0:10:17.020,0:10:19.440
hello world dot c

0:10:19.440,0:10:22.670
cannibal print the first time lines

0:10:22.670,0:10:24.990
began pressed detect a own

0:10:24.990,0:10:27.280
and increase a tail webpage

0:10:27.280,0:10:31.220
html it's going to give is the very last
hemlines

0:10:31.220,0:10:33.260
so there's the last ten lines

0:10:33.260,0:10:35.250
right here of the tail

0:10:35.250,0:10:38.810
that's the bottom about filed

0:10:38.810,0:10:42.070
those are helpful to take a look at
what's going on and came out to clear

0:10:42.070,0:10:43.140
data files

0:10:43.140,0:10:45.020
we can also do you all wordcount

0:10:45.020,0:10:50.270
so they'll give us the number of words
and lines in a final silver account

0:10:50.270,0:10:52.160
hello world dot c

0:10:52.160,0:10:54.530
and this tells us that we have

0:10:54.530,0:10:56.410
uh... believe it's

0:10:56.410,0:10:58.020
eleven lines

0:10:58.020,0:10:59.650
twenty nine words

0:10:59.650,0:11:02.420
two hundred ninety eight characters

0:11:02.420,0:11:04.580
then we can also say

0:11:04.580,0:11:10.050
if we had apparel coming back and at
this and dash l will give us lines only

0:11:10.050,0:11:15.980
so here we've got that we just have
eleven line several c

0:11:15.980,0:11:20.139
now it is an important command in unix
that will tell us all about what's

0:11:20.139,0:11:22.160
in files as much as they can

0:11:22.160,0:11:24.220
and that's the file command so

0:11:24.220,0:11:27.160
if we use star which represents any file

0:11:27.160,0:11:29.420
taken action on this directory

0:11:29.420,0:11:30.860
it's going to go through

0:11:30.860,0:11:34.110
soccer game is the file space star
command

0:11:34.110,0:11:35.090
it will tell us

0:11:35.090,0:11:36.960
bullet things each of the files are

0:11:36.960,0:11:39.410
sort start off with

0:11:39.410,0:11:42.710
file sample dot piya

0:11:42.710,0:11:43.959
and that shows that

0:11:43.959,0:11:45.300
it looks in that file

0:11:45.300,0:11:50.340
didn't look at the pediatric on the file
name excellence in the file

0:11:50.340,0:11:53.279
it's it's p_b_s_ document version one
point five

0:11:53.279,0:11:56.579
now freezing laughs you got to take a
look at that file

0:11:56.579,0:12:03.430
and see what it took a peek into

0:12:03.430,0:12:06.530
it wasn't very exciting

0:12:06.530,0:12:10.560
savimex command of arena duties
identifying

0:12:10.560,0:12:12.460
now this command

0:12:12.460,0:12:16.160
knows about images certain knows more
about what's going on so if we take a

0:12:16.160,0:12:19.260
look at how a startup p_n_g_

0:12:19.260,0:12:23.800
and helped i think i will start dot t_
iof

0:12:23.800,0:12:25.300
j paying

0:12:25.300,0:12:26.150
affect

0:12:26.150,0:12:28.900
to have any images of mr trie everytime

0:12:28.900,0:12:31.830
so extensions are not necessarily

0:12:31.830,0:12:32.650
mandated

0:12:32.650,0:12:37.070
so in this case it's j_p_ he genes we
have one jate hain

0:12:37.070,0:12:39.130
if we say file

0:12:39.130,0:12:40.000
and this

0:12:40.000,0:12:41.330
particular picture

0:12:41.330,0:12:45.290
it just tells the jury peg if we say
identified

0:12:45.290,0:12:47.210
two thousand eleven pressed pam

0:12:47.210,0:12:48.240
tuesday

0:12:48.240,0:12:52.220
you'll see that tells us more actual
tells us the width and height budget peg

0:12:52.220,0:12:55.360
and some other fancy information about
that and keep it

0:12:55.360,0:12:56.150
image

0:12:56.150,0:12:58.620
a few things like that

0:12:58.620,0:12:59.720
now we've done a lot

0:12:59.720,0:13:01.660
but it might be hopeful to see

0:13:01.660,0:13:03.250
what we've got

0:13:03.250,0:13:04.709
that we've done our past

0:13:04.709,0:13:09.090
if you wanted to know stevie to paste
some of those things marie run them

0:13:09.090,0:13:14.550
detected history command this is going
to list out everything that we've done

0:13:14.550,0:13:17.670
press history there's a lot so in this
case

0:13:17.670,0:13:23.180
you might want to do something like pay
almost vertical bar here exculpate

0:13:23.180,0:13:26.610
and that pipe will actually take data
that comes out of the history command

0:13:26.610,0:13:28.700
and pass it over to the tail command

0:13:28.700,0:13:31.400
so give us the washed and

0:13:31.400,0:13:32.450
uh... entries

0:13:32.450,0:13:35.250
if we were won a rerun one of those we
can

0:13:35.250,0:13:37.820
to estimation market and then

0:13:37.820,0:13:41.700
that command number so let's go ahead a
rerun this identified command here

0:13:41.700,0:13:43.770
sold to bang

0:13:43.770,0:13:47.500
which is the mother works best mission
work seven three two

0:13:47.500,0:13:53.370
and there is room yet and if i can't

0:13:53.370,0:13:57.500
now you can also do hum

0:13:57.500,0:14:02.190
technical grep so if we have history
they want to grab for

0:14:02.190,0:14:06.950
particular string this is a search
commendable search inside of text for

0:14:06.950,0:14:09.780
any patterns that matches it's very
fancy

0:14:09.780,0:14:14.230
when a simple case we just give it a our
basic string so free trade

0:14:14.230,0:14:15.800
j_p_ ichi

0:14:15.800,0:14:21.040
we're gonna search for any commander in
our history and i had before letters j p

0:14:21.040,0:14:21.980
ichi

0:14:21.980,0:14:23.690
the scripture

0:14:23.690,0:14:25.500
for breast cancer

0:14:25.500,0:14:30.840
will see that we actually ran a whole
bunch of other commands

0:14:30.840,0:14:33.460
four letters to a pagan and you'll see
that it's actually been nice enough to

0:14:33.460,0:14:38.250
highlight for us where found the matches
for each of those lines

0:14:38.250,0:14:42.140
that could also do you uh... the exact
opposite within two dash v was says

0:14:42.140,0:14:48.400
don't tell us anything rejected and it
uh... anyone that has to pay wildcats

0:14:48.400,0:14:50.440
printed out

0:14:50.440,0:14:54.770
so that a prepaid telma gets group
cheney's together certificate the last

0:14:54.770,0:14:56.730
time

0:14:56.730,0:15:01.590
our history grad j peg will not be in
this live sofa detail

0:15:01.590,0:15:03.220
keeping history

0:15:03.220,0:15:04.870
but at the table

0:15:04.870,0:15:08.870
there is actually coming in here that we
should have seen that that

0:15:08.870,0:15:15.870
grab for jay pence and that was removed
by that the graph minus feed

0:15:16.880,0:15:21.540
can in the beginning i had to be our agm
can actually showed me

0:15:21.540,0:15:26.740
that um... the r and commander boys
asking a question yes or no it's not

0:15:26.740,0:15:30.440
their fault behavior and there's
something called aliases so if i say the

0:15:30.440,0:15:32.220
commands tight

0:15:32.220,0:15:34.340
tfc type the word typed

0:15:34.340,0:15:38.780
and then i say arround it's gonna tell
me that's helios too

0:15:38.780,0:15:42.310
par and with this dash high command in
the nationalize what ask you do you

0:15:42.310,0:15:44.980
really want to delete that file

0:15:44.980,0:15:50.720
now thank you type space dash pay our
agm and actually stands for pol here

0:15:50.720,0:15:55.560
said sent only all the places you can
find our agm on this computer

0:15:55.560,0:16:00.640
and it's actually finding a program in
this path called slash bin slash sharam

0:16:00.640,0:16:03.790
so that's a system program called r m

0:16:03.790,0:16:05.480
and i'm actually using

0:16:05.480,0:16:09.520
resilience which then gets a pass to
this commitment so ends up

0:16:09.520,0:16:11.170
putting this together

0:16:11.170,0:16:14.920
make a list all other illnesses but just
typing the word alias

0:16:14.920,0:16:17.460
and to see that there is actually quite
a few releases that come with the

0:16:17.460,0:16:22.370
standard setup of your going to buckets

0:16:22.370,0:16:24.220
so now let's uh...

0:16:24.220,0:16:27.940
wrapped up for their and will do another
video in the future nasa thanks for

0:16:27.940,0:16:29.510
joining and i hope this was helpful
