hello and welcome to u video a pic of
research tools two thousand eleven

0:00:05.500,0:00:07.610
is videos python part to you

0:00:07.610,0:00:09.329
wearing tight on

0:00:09.329,0:00:11.369
in this field i'll be going through

0:00:11.369,0:00:14.359
many of the way so you can run python

0:00:14.359,0:00:15.819
there are quite a few

0:00:15.819,0:00:19.269
and this will give you a sense of the
diversity of ways the python can be

0:00:19.269,0:00:20.720
called

0:00:20.720,0:00:24.009
that might be a little confusing so i
recommend going through just taking a

0:00:24.009,0:00:24.550
look

0:00:24.550,0:00:27.359
come watching it and then coming back
through and trying to understand how

0:00:27.359,0:00:30.189
each of them is different

0:00:30.189,0:00:32.910
let's go ahead and get started by mister
alright

0:00:32.910,0:00:38.320
configuring my email expand my bash
arcing

0:00:38.320,0:00:42.160
now i've got open here

0:00:42.160,0:00:46.330
uh... configuration file that's helping
me out called uh... video eight uh...

0:00:46.330,0:00:51.030
organ this is just my notes for today

0:00:51.030,0:00:54.160
now delicate rolex tutsies but uh...

0:00:54.160,0:00:57.550
the buffer here and i'm gonna go ahead
and and it might dot

0:00:57.550,0:01:00.700
dash r_c_ final

0:01:00.700,0:01:03.099
in a minute on the bottom and that's
actually a

0:01:03.099,0:01:05.650
amanda and i think greater then

0:01:05.650,0:01:07.799
turn off the bottom

0:01:07.799,0:01:10.630
control lexico jump over to buffers

0:01:10.630,0:01:15.090
i really want to grab the satellite
hirschfeld control space down would be a

0:01:15.090,0:01:18.070
real and then uh... w_-two copied

0:01:18.070,0:01:22.600
control expose jumped back over to the
window and control wide

0:01:22.600,0:01:24.220
yet

0:01:24.220,0:01:28.310
i'm gonna go ahead and say that
controllers controller us

0:01:28.310,0:01:31.760
we won't be using this one in the studio
but this is a great time to get in there

0:01:31.760,0:01:35.909
and actually see it and it

0:01:35.909,0:01:39.360
okay so now the next in the ready to
configure are set up

0:01:39.360,0:01:43.570
is for a look at our documents final
sonika control expo

0:01:43.570,0:01:46.250
controllers controller left open the
file

0:01:46.250,0:01:50.840
and our team acts like i_b_m_ pressed
have interesting facts

0:01:50.840,0:01:53.830
there's currently nothing in my
documents while he may have stuff in

0:01:53.830,0:01:56.009
here that you're adding to

0:01:56.009,0:01:59.170
and the first section that i mean and is

0:01:59.170,0:02:01.649
break in here or copy this text

0:02:01.649,0:02:06.189
pictured in not to copy the pound plus
and source begin source

0:02:06.189,0:02:09.310
tzameret w copied control expo

0:02:09.310,0:02:10.519
and yet

0:02:10.519,0:02:12.059
puts it we have here

0:02:12.059,0:02:13.120
in this section

0:02:13.120,0:02:16.709
we're telling team acts that we really
want to use of or growing

0:02:16.709,0:02:18.320
so soon or install

0:02:18.320,0:02:21.980
and that is telling it which languages
we would like to have a install for

0:02:21.980,0:02:24.239
actually writing scripts

0:02:24.239,0:02:26.329
the ones that we need for sure in this

0:02:26.329,0:02:30.329
video are estate for bashed hymns

0:02:30.329,0:02:33.219
take long for a python code

0:02:33.219,0:02:36.569
in here i also have some notes you can
add some more so let's go ahead and grab

0:02:36.569,0:02:40.459
a few more languages that might be
useful to people down the road

0:02:40.459,0:02:45.569
the copy this section at W to explode
and look over here at uh... pythons

0:02:45.569,0:02:49.589
complete agreement

0:02:49.589,0:02:52.849
so now we have our languages and their
spent on this is a running until we

0:02:52.849,0:02:54.479
restore imax

0:02:54.479,0:02:57.239
with you control expo

0:02:57.239,0:03:01.019
and we want to make sure that we've got
karki mac server running all time so we

0:03:01.019,0:03:04.090
want to be able to asking us to add a
file for us

0:03:04.090,0:03:05.989
sold to uh... minute w

0:03:05.989,0:03:08.340
copy this section

0:03:08.340,0:03:09.469
hand

0:03:09.469,0:03:11.869
pasted here with a controlled wine

0:03:11.869,0:03:13.799
and in this section

0:03:13.799,0:03:15.340
we have this

0:03:15.340,0:03:19.659
request here to not close the window
after a dominating pathfinder like it's

0:03:19.659,0:03:22.579
a little confusing if things disappear
quickly on this

0:03:22.579,0:03:26.040
and every time we starting next we want
to run the server that will listen for

0:03:26.040,0:03:30.099
edit requests and take care of for us

0:03:30.099,0:03:34.259
and we're also going to have some
shortcuts teen max so in here

0:03:34.259,0:03:37.249
we have some shortcuts for or grown

0:03:37.249,0:03:39.550
these are the recommended one cemented w

0:03:39.550,0:03:41.749
control exposed

0:03:41.749,0:03:42.829
paste

0:03:42.829,0:03:46.840
the shortcuts are often used to you
handle things that were grown

0:03:46.840,0:03:50.239
real peace in the city of maxwell
pertinent

0:03:50.239,0:03:52.579
into the ones that we will use

0:03:52.579,0:03:56.079
to figure out here and copied these
shortcuts

0:03:56.079,0:03:58.199
a w towards over

0:03:58.199,0:04:03.839
the shortcuts are for the f one f kyuki
some top left your keyboard

0:04:03.839,0:04:07.669
and the says control x controlled she is
going to find in case you actually want

0:04:07.669,0:04:10.689
to jump to a line number explicitly

0:04:10.689,0:04:13.790
you can see right here the only numbers
actually written on the screen seepage

0:04:13.790,0:04:18.579
of scrolled appointed for the big file
becca get difficult

0:04:18.579,0:04:22.000
okay so now i need to u star restart
mighty max

0:04:22.000,0:04:27.909
flamingo india and tells me to do them
filter control x control c

0:04:27.909,0:04:30.470
imax is now gone

0:04:30.470,0:04:35.819
go ahead every thirty minutes ministry
kept so it all fits in the

0:04:35.819,0:04:38.660
being

0:04:38.660,0:04:41.780
okay and let's close to the parent
fireman's thank you and tell us that

0:04:41.780,0:04:42.670
shell

0:04:42.670,0:04:45.219
you can see that i have the delete

0:04:45.219,0:04:49.439
file here our actually make a
subdirectory to make their

0:04:49.439,0:04:50.659
video

0:04:50.659,0:04:54.509
slash eight and to be able to make
multiple directions him time after two

0:04:54.509,0:04:55.669
dash key

0:04:55.669,0:04:57.229
cd

0:04:57.229,0:04:59.799
last c_d_ into video

0:04:59.799,0:05:01.319
slash eight

0:05:01.319,0:05:06.940
and will move till two slash if u dash
eat dot org

0:05:06.940,0:05:10.889
this way we have fewer things around and
it'll be a lot more

0:05:10.889,0:05:15.439
awfully easy to follow sold now inside
of arguments we're going to go

0:05:15.439,0:05:19.149
open that directory separate relax
control half

0:05:19.149,0:05:23.680
and video parents of the event amt

0:05:23.680,0:05:27.050
and press enter this is going to go open
the directory that were in

0:05:27.050,0:05:31.379
thirty reruns directory and i can just
press return a rancher on that

0:05:31.379,0:05:34.159
wonderful for me

0:05:34.159,0:05:39.429
and then use the time ki to collapsed
this down to an outline known so shift

0:05:39.429,0:05:41.529
time

0:05:41.529,0:05:43.560
now class down to the

0:05:43.560,0:05:45.719
papua heading so we can follow along

0:05:45.719,0:05:49.959
a little better

0:05:49.959,0:05:52.629
swung

0:05:52.629,0:05:54.820
nimble tread stance against it

0:05:54.820,0:05:58.399
so we've now restarted and our documents

0:05:58.399,0:06:02.699
and we're gonna skip onto running python

0:06:02.699,0:06:06.009
soon lots and lots of ways we can run
python intimal walk through some of

0:06:06.009,0:06:06.800
these

0:06:06.800,0:06:10.439
first for a short offer some overtime
and one ways to do it

0:06:10.439,0:06:16.180
sewing here we can just use the python
schultz i had time on that takes tammy's

0:06:16.180,0:06:19.889
and we can just i placed on a breast
cancer

0:06:19.889,0:06:22.509
so if i take place on

0:06:22.509,0:06:27.069
presenter and now i a python shell i
can't say on post to

0:06:27.069,0:06:29.830
get the results

0:06:29.830,0:06:32.580
hello world

0:06:32.580,0:06:34.300
and if we can not

0:06:34.300,0:06:38.129
there's a couple different ways to exact
decompress control team which is sort of

0:06:38.129,0:06:40.570
the and of the file representation or

0:06:40.570,0:06:44.299
prolly more clear here's a type exit and
parentheses

0:06:44.299,0:06:46.430
and we're now back to our command line

0:06:46.430,0:06:48.800
fashion

0:06:48.800,0:06:53.369
so that's that one moorhead timed now go
to the one-liner

0:06:53.369,0:06:54.560
with this position

0:06:54.560,0:06:59.210
mora pro-ltte style type thing but it
works here too because it's a print

0:06:59.210,0:07:01.430
dash he says we're going to pass it

0:07:01.430,0:07:05.120
a little bit of pythons around in the
state print

0:07:05.120,0:07:06.770
one plus two

0:07:06.770,0:07:08.400
to put this in quotes

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.870
anti come on now

0:07:11.870,0:07:15.340
we have a multi printable taipei taiwan

0:07:15.340,0:07:19.770
okay sizzle skin will hit enter came to
get back to number three

0:07:19.770,0:07:25.469
comfort citing but can be helpful

0:07:25.469,0:07:27.009
through the next one is

0:07:27.009,0:07:31.269
we can actually create file monitoring
that file from the command line

0:07:31.269,0:07:36.419
so if you use press control c control c
inside here you know i think that

0:07:36.419,0:07:37.779
this file creating

0:07:37.779,0:07:40.210
so we'll do that control c

0:07:40.210,0:07:44.680
control c it wants to evaluate this code
yes

0:07:44.680,0:07:47.229
and there was no results that's okay

0:07:47.229,0:07:50.430
let's take a look at this files create
called

0:07:50.430,0:07:53.529
low topon

0:07:53.529,0:07:59.539
to tell us that shell we have a hell of
a pauline cat followed up on

0:07:59.539,0:08:01.690
so here we have just back in there

0:08:01.690,0:08:02.270
and we can run

0:08:02.270,0:08:06.560
not like this tight on space in our file
named so

0:08:06.560,0:08:09.029
eighty fallon press time

0:08:09.029,0:08:12.309
and it runs hello

0:08:12.309,0:08:14.999
works pretty well

0:08:14.999,0:08:15.860
let's close

0:08:15.860,0:08:18.459
that morning

0:08:18.459,0:08:19.479
and

0:08:19.479,0:08:23.129
the script file part here is is
interesting unfpa walkers did buydig

0:08:23.129,0:08:27.439
rather than actually run protecting
their own once

0:08:27.439,0:08:29.410
so that more creative file

0:08:29.410,0:08:31.060
like that in the second

0:08:31.060,0:08:36.940
but if we come here and we want to just
try to run are hello

0:08:36.940,0:08:38.760
top i

0:08:38.760,0:08:42.930
like that led to the program has any old
twenty three x programs

0:08:42.930,0:08:46.220
zinc going to work it's going to take a
look at the first line and try to figure

0:08:46.220,0:08:47.200
out

0:08:47.200,0:08:51.550
what kind of scripted isn't things start
off by assuming it's about trapped

0:08:51.550,0:08:53.390
and

0:08:53.390,0:08:55.019
we get permission denied

0:08:55.019,0:08:58.570
annexation he too had permission to pick
if it's right there

0:08:58.570,0:09:00.300
so let's go

0:09:00.300,0:09:01.680
create this file

0:09:01.680,0:09:03.510
school say

0:09:03.510,0:09:06.310
hellos two top iron

0:09:06.310,0:09:08.380
the control x control path

0:09:08.380,0:09:10.880
the first line held back

0:09:10.880,0:09:13.520
that this is clearly a python script

0:09:13.520,0:09:17.230
u_b_s_ then he and he is a program that
looks in the

0:09:17.230,0:09:19.600
the users paths figure out where

0:09:19.600,0:09:21.390
icons gennady

0:09:21.390,0:09:25.750
that way they can actually control which
python difficult will take into account

0:09:25.750,0:09:27.930
in our case we just have one

0:09:27.930,0:09:30.010
trainer script will save print

0:09:30.010,0:09:31.080
hello

0:09:31.080,0:09:35.350
world

0:09:35.350,0:09:38.940
time period if you will stay with the
trolex control its

0:09:38.940,0:09:42.510
and now we have a script on disk we can
give it a lot of special

0:09:42.510,0:09:43.680
and if you look

0:09:43.680,0:09:45.189
paraded out here

0:09:45.189,0:09:51.100
their is no execute gets set so we need
to tactile this uh... system that we

0:09:51.100,0:09:53.850
won't be able to run this associates mon

0:09:53.850,0:10:00.850
plus axe is going to set the execute
will flag on this script

0:10:00.980,0:10:04.040
to chuck pine

0:10:04.040,0:10:07.710
and if you do it cost us shall you'll
now see that their taxes through here

0:10:07.710,0:10:10.560
which means that

0:10:10.560,0:10:15.440
the user can execute this anybody in the
critics keep that in anyone system can

0:10:15.440,0:10:17.670
also execute expert

0:10:17.670,0:10:20.300
so now we can go ahead and run our hello

0:10:20.300,0:10:22.290
to dot pine

0:10:22.290,0:10:25.310
and the princess hello world team

0:10:25.310,0:10:28.050
this is the typical way that you would
set up a script if if you're going to

0:10:28.050,0:10:32.830
give to somebody and have them

0:10:32.830,0:10:33.920
all right

0:10:33.920,0:10:37.730
let's go into the fence here so i put on

0:10:37.730,0:10:40.470
and this is where it if you are
developing stuff you're more likely to

0:10:40.470,0:10:41.850
spend your time

0:10:41.850,0:10:42.900
so we can type

0:10:42.900,0:10:45.060
i pump

0:10:45.060,0:10:49.530
it looks a little bit different than the
regular price on show

0:10:49.530,0:10:53.690
and just like the rate of her time so we
can type whatever we wanted to it

0:10:53.690,0:10:55.380
if they want to ask you

0:10:55.380,0:10:59.470
and i will tell us that the answer's
three

0:10:59.470,0:11:02.310
we can't also run the script

0:11:02.310,0:11:05.130
so if we do it collapsed ashok

0:11:05.130,0:11:07.340
and look forward to the browns

0:11:07.340,0:11:10.690
now note that a pound file it is a
backup file

0:11:10.690,0:11:12.470
to ignore those

0:11:12.470,0:11:16.500
and we can then say iran

0:11:16.500,0:11:17.970
topon

0:11:17.970,0:11:21.880
or we can actually even run safety a
period the previous mentally to talk you

0:11:21.880,0:11:22.670
why

0:11:22.670,0:11:25.530
and i'll run that it doesn't need to
know that there's

0:11:25.530,0:11:29.240
first-line are not saying that this is
part of the justice into everything

0:11:29.240,0:11:33.660
inspect them

0:11:33.660,0:11:36.880
hands we can also important filed

0:11:36.880,0:11:39.920
so this assumes that this thing is
what's called the modules we could see

0:11:39.920,0:11:41.650
imports

0:11:41.650,0:11:42.670
hello

0:11:42.670,0:11:45.780
and when it goes through that file able
actually run any

0:11:45.780,0:11:46.460
anything through

0:11:46.460,0:11:49.650
mayor and set up into our environment

0:11:49.650,0:11:55.930
and part of that won the contents was
print also catch hello dogpile

0:11:55.930,0:11:57.460
says print hello world

0:11:57.460,0:12:01.670
now straight again weaken the apparent
place to go back to our old import

0:12:01.670,0:12:03.820
mindcrest enter

0:12:03.820,0:12:06.450
and nothing happens it's a little
strange

0:12:06.450,0:12:10.160
but what's going on here is that tight
on realizes it's already imported health

0:12:10.160,0:12:11.860
p hello module

0:12:11.860,0:12:14.450
so it doesn't need to do anything else

0:12:14.450,0:12:17.220
worksheet that we need to say reload

0:12:17.220,0:12:20.160
and you can either put the preface
easier nantes

0:12:20.160,0:12:23.670
and anti-democrat u_n_ conferences that
they're missing

0:12:23.670,0:12:25.290
so we can say

0:12:25.290,0:12:26.340
preloader

0:12:26.340,0:12:28.540
hello

0:12:28.540,0:12:32.560
and you see that you print that hello
world of its reloading the module

0:12:32.560,0:12:34.289
and it tells a lot about that

0:12:34.289,0:12:38.620
paper that this particular module

0:12:38.620,0:12:43.350
so that was our comport

0:12:43.350,0:12:44.870
and

0:12:44.870,0:12:48.680
that will work quite well you can do a
lot of work for mayor we can do it from

0:12:48.680,0:12:53.390
imax

0:12:53.390,0:12:56.010
so let's go ahead and create a file

0:12:56.010,0:12:59.530
called video feet

0:12:59.530,0:13:02.250
b_t_u_ pete stark time

0:13:02.250,0:13:06.150
birth control x controller open the file

0:13:06.150,0:13:07.800
and in their we're going to

0:13:07.800,0:13:10.280
clinton this text in the middle

0:13:10.280,0:13:12.000
so i do that controls

0:13:12.000,0:13:13.480
face at the beginning

0:13:13.480,0:13:16.510
and then uh... w at the bottom

0:13:16.510,0:13:19.130
and pasting without the buchanan and
source

0:13:19.130,0:13:22.830
toasted dot controllers controller us

0:13:22.830,0:13:24.590
controllers control from that

0:13:24.590,0:13:26.860
and then just info without the control

0:13:26.860,0:13:29.150
jumps to the other windham

0:13:29.150,0:13:30.640
now we've got that suddam

0:13:30.640,0:13:35.260
will scroll down here to the run the
whole file

0:13:35.260,0:13:39.900
control expo through in here for one
more files you can be anywhere

0:13:39.900,0:13:41.830
and just have control c

0:13:41.830,0:13:45.270
and then a second controls the

0:13:45.270,0:13:46.619
what happens is

0:13:46.619,0:13:49.999
in this paper output buffer it will
write out everything that would go on

0:13:49.999,0:13:52.600
here so for the through the first line

0:13:52.600,0:13:56.870
is printed star my script ended today
right here

0:13:56.870,0:14:00.100
when we come in here print more stuff we
see more stuff

0:14:00.100,0:14:04.960
and we see the three-plus he's come out
here as eleven

0:14:04.960,0:14:09.060
control access and then i'd be happy to
switch buffer unlucky enough to find

0:14:09.060,0:14:12.240
video preference in aspen re

0:14:12.240,0:14:14.460
so that was the whole file and

0:14:14.460,0:14:17.790
that worked pretty well but you don't
always want to run the whole final and

0:14:17.790,0:14:21.540
part of that can be as justice like
small portion of the code and

0:14:21.540,0:14:23.160
from that

0:14:23.160,0:14:27.530
so let's schedule expo analytic a range
of current so what if we just want to

0:14:27.530,0:14:30.600
run the swine cited a control space

0:14:30.600,0:14:31.760
at the beginning

0:14:31.760,0:14:33.449
and i moved down one line

0:14:33.449,0:14:36.780
i covered all the code i want to run

0:14:36.780,0:14:40.480
i can do a control facts sees me a
controlled

0:14:40.480,0:14:42.580
control g is quite so we'll see you

0:14:42.580,0:14:43.720
hurt the region

0:14:43.720,0:14:46.090
control c and the vertical bar or

0:14:46.090,0:14:47.850
type character

0:14:47.850,0:14:52.740
anymore and just want to work related to
let me do that again the proliferation

0:14:52.740,0:14:55.300
soviet control space right here

0:14:55.300,0:14:56.550
with the prints

0:14:56.550,0:15:01.370
move down cover those two and controlled
c_n_n_ vertical bar will run those two

0:15:01.370,0:15:03.170
lines

0:15:03.170,0:15:05.339
in that way you can run a bit of code

0:15:05.339,0:15:07.040
within a script if you're looking at

0:15:07.040,0:15:10.260
assuming that that actually makes sense
to do if it's

0:15:10.260,0:15:13.450
something like opening a file was done
before that and you have to run that

0:15:13.450,0:15:19.340
will follow re-open so if you get a
little confusing sometimes

0:15:19.340,0:15:21.020
closed on them

0:15:21.020,0:15:25.570
now we can also switched to python shell
insanity max

0:15:25.570,0:15:27.530
if we do u any

0:15:27.530,0:15:30.560
control c exclamation point

0:15:30.560,0:15:33.100
we are now inside of

0:15:33.100,0:15:38.150
so we can save three four six nine three
eight seven eleven

0:15:38.150,0:15:40.800
and we can do whatever we want to print

0:15:40.800,0:15:43.660
hello world

0:15:43.660,0:15:45.900
and their church forgetting have

0:15:45.900,0:15:49.160
through a python terminal

0:15:49.160,0:15:53.150
we can also go back up here to our
videotape simply select a region of code

0:15:53.150,0:15:56.100
on the run control c vertical bar

0:15:56.100,0:15:57.139
to run a region

0:15:57.139,0:16:01.419
you'll see that it's actually using
michelle's to run that coding to make a

0:16:01.419,0:16:05.190
temporary file very strange immigrants
often runs that

0:16:05.190,0:16:08.820
so we can also run the whole thing
control c control c

0:16:08.820,0:16:15.820
and it went off create another temporary
file and ran our entire trip from there

0:16:18.120,0:16:20.050
mystical career are

0:16:20.050,0:16:24.160
we can also use something called the
compile commands to run the script

0:16:24.160,0:16:26.150
so if we do

0:16:26.150,0:16:27.350
acts

0:16:27.350,0:16:28.710
compile

0:16:28.710,0:16:32.110
but before you do that i will stand that
stephen stephen doing

0:16:32.110,0:16:34.540
so many x compiled

0:16:34.540,0:16:38.070
is typically meant to compile seas were
screwed with acting as if they can be

0:16:38.070,0:16:41.640
used for just about anything to get rid
of this meeting dash k which we don't

0:16:41.640,0:16:43.180
care about

0:16:43.180,0:16:45.160
and we say python

0:16:45.160,0:16:46.680
hello dot pie

0:16:46.680,0:16:50.130
it's gonna look at the current directory
and writer on the state run dot

0:16:50.130,0:16:51.600
hello tupac

0:16:51.600,0:16:53.210
to express entered

0:16:53.210,0:16:55.630
and it rain off and we actually see

0:16:55.630,0:16:58.480
a hello world right here

0:16:58.480,0:17:00.270
so that's very nice

0:17:00.270,0:17:03.210
and there's a sample of it in the notes

0:17:03.210,0:17:06.990
we can also run any script doesn't have
to be

0:17:06.990,0:17:08.640
uh... python

0:17:08.640,0:17:11.190
space in the script name so we can do

0:17:11.190,0:17:13.929
matter x compiled

0:17:13.929,0:17:17.329
and we can also just replaced that with
tonsillitis

0:17:17.329,0:17:19.079
hello

0:17:19.079,0:17:23.579
to job behind and more super on the
scripts to have that first line

0:17:23.579,0:17:27.449
that looks like palin banking serving in
the item

0:17:27.449,0:17:28.400
presenter

0:17:28.400,0:17:35.170
and there's our hello world

0:17:35.170,0:17:37.000
keeps going down here

0:17:37.000,0:17:40.950
now we also have and here is to be
treated with r dot e max file so if we

0:17:40.950,0:17:42.330
do functioned

0:17:42.330,0:17:44.750
f_-one

0:17:44.750,0:17:47.730
it actually brings up that compartment
right away you can see me at the

0:17:47.730,0:17:49.970
keyboard but that's what i didn't

0:17:49.970,0:17:53.740
and then you can rerun the script that
makes it really easy to do with one

0:17:53.740,0:17:58.110
keystrokes just what the f one key and
you re run your script

0:17:58.110,0:18:01.500
it's great for when you're developing
stuff quickly

0:18:01.500,0:18:04.470
now let's see what happens if there's an
air we need

0:18:04.470,0:18:07.550
to be able to have imax help us out with

0:18:07.550,0:18:11.159
trouble spots so limited control expo

0:18:11.159,0:18:13.190
control xvi

0:18:13.190,0:18:17.290
here we are going to go to the u_p_s_
dot pine center

0:18:17.290,0:18:22.610
and that's been the line that is
definitely not right

0:18:22.610,0:18:26.460
maybe we meant to put in single quotes
for the string printout nothing then but

0:18:26.460,0:18:28.810
the stefan is not going to work

0:18:28.810,0:18:33.850
i think judy and foreign format x
compiled

0:18:33.850,0:18:35.750
japan announced

0:18:35.750,0:18:41.549
or we can do a cc sold to a control c
control seat

0:18:41.549,0:18:42.280
and

0:18:42.280,0:18:43.770
it says nothing did

0:18:43.770,0:18:47.419
and to take this to repair a message
right here so we'll do that again store

0:18:47.419,0:18:51.390
cursory sitting right here in some of
the wind control c

0:18:51.390,0:18:53.080
control scheme

0:18:53.080,0:18:57.140
and it takes is right to you

0:18:57.140,0:19:01.030
chicas rhetorical spot does not get
showing us up here in our terminal

0:19:01.030,0:19:04.100
what's going on

0:19:04.100,0:19:08.670
so it's pretty nice being able to cd
image pop up

0:19:08.670,0:19:11.820
now if we won't know really see what's
going on what's

0:19:11.820,0:19:14.250
killed us yes

0:19:14.250,0:19:17.870
shows a controller skate kill them

0:19:17.870,0:19:19.850
piano three run the

0:19:19.850,0:19:23.100
without that shelves running around the
background images

0:19:23.100,0:19:25.740
let's give it a go again animal to you

0:19:25.740,0:19:27.840
control c control c

0:19:27.840,0:19:30.440
and at this time without that shall
running around

0:19:30.440,0:19:33.509
it popped up a nice little message
appear

0:19:33.509,0:19:37.049
and it took us right along with the
troubles on the move the cursory here to

0:19:37.049,0:19:37.960
print

0:19:37.960,0:19:39.710
and what do you control c

0:19:39.710,0:19:41.610
controls here in the whole script

0:19:41.610,0:19:45.220
and it says i'm actually jump into line
six and taking your a career error

0:19:45.220,0:19:48.940
messages at least as far as i can tell

0:19:48.940,0:19:52.110
very nice if you're working with a long
script and you have about somewhere if

0:19:52.110,0:19:56.810
you will take you right the trouble spot

0:19:56.810,0:20:02.100
payment schedule prior notice

0:20:02.100,0:20:06.890
okay let's try that with the compile
commands so for norman tax compile some

0:20:06.890,0:20:09.120
here's my compiled

0:20:09.120,0:20:15.570
and we're gonna go ahead and say
payphone the e_u_ h dot pine pressed

0:20:15.570,0:20:17.090
pinter

0:20:17.090,0:20:18.260
and that's the nice thing

0:20:18.260,0:20:22.580
when you're working for the email us if
you've ever file it hasn't saved it

0:20:22.580,0:20:26.240
you are actually say do you really want
it keep praying this without saving it

0:20:26.240,0:20:30.440
we wanna stated so yes it's asking us to
save

0:20:30.440,0:20:33.360
and we have an error message it's a
little bit more worried

0:20:33.360,0:20:35.400
but if we look down here it's actually
saying

0:20:35.400,0:20:37.390
where it is just like before

0:20:37.390,0:20:40.070
and if we do

0:20:40.070,0:20:41.320
met attacks

0:20:41.320,0:20:45.169
next

0:20:45.169,0:20:47.530
error i'm in the press answer

0:20:47.530,0:20:49.970
that success rate connector message

0:20:49.970,0:20:53.370
and we also have an alias for that and
that's the eft yuki

0:20:53.370,0:20:56.320
so we can't do that again took off one
ball

0:20:56.320,0:20:57.460
run-ins

0:20:57.460,0:21:04.460
repressed journal for you got to it's
because right along the trouble is

0:21:06.250,0:21:09.170
pretty heaney

0:21:09.170,0:21:12.200
animal keeps thrown down here and catch
up

0:21:12.200,0:21:15.760
and now we're where the spot where we
can actually run things from inside of

0:21:15.760,0:21:20.670
he max itself control ax ones which is
look at that time impressed have

0:21:20.670,0:21:22.299
to expand the south

0:21:22.299,0:21:27.070
and wants press control c control c
insider than or grows hoarse block

0:21:27.070,0:21:30.070
so the pressure just has to be in
between these two u

0:21:30.070,0:21:33.710
begin and sources where you control c
control c

0:21:33.710,0:21:37.490
it says do you want or violate this code
yes we would like to suggest president

0:21:37.490,0:21:38.970
herb

0:21:38.970,0:21:40.520
in unfortunately

0:21:40.520,0:21:43.350
the results are magnet

0:21:43.350,0:21:46.450
now this is a slight problem with the
way they did

0:21:46.450,0:21:50.100
power or go to set up for the court
babble for papon

0:21:50.100,0:21:51.320
you actually have to return

0:21:51.320,0:21:53.510
earn thing that you want printed

0:21:53.510,0:21:54.750
so in this case will return

0:21:54.750,0:21:57.980
earned the string teller lord i will try
to you

0:21:57.980,0:22:01.190
and we'll get more into returns we'll
look into functions cannot upcoming

0:22:01.190,0:22:05.990
video so few controls the control see
inside of this type yes

0:22:05.990,0:22:09.230
and your answer comes right back here so
if we then said

0:22:09.230,0:22:12.480
let's take another one

0:22:12.480,0:22:16.360
count and aristide pound plus pekin

0:22:16.360,0:22:17.309
source

0:22:17.309,0:22:18.620
pipeline

0:22:18.620,0:22:22.010
will say return

0:22:22.010,0:22:25.290
fifties for sixty five times

0:22:25.290,0:22:26.560
ninety one

0:22:26.560,0:22:30.060
and pound plus and source

0:22:30.060,0:22:32.870
hemel tight control c controlled seat

0:22:32.870,0:22:34.850
we do it i read it yet

0:22:34.850,0:22:37.630
and here comes our muscle mass answer

0:22:37.630,0:22:40.680
so that way you can do for the
repeatable researcher reproducible

0:22:40.680,0:22:42.670
research style of

0:22:42.670,0:22:43.750
riding out

0:22:43.750,0:22:48.370
what's going on so here in this case i
would write out

0:22:48.370,0:22:51.210
a description

0:22:51.210,0:22:53.650
of what high ham

0:22:53.650,0:22:54.490
doing

0:22:54.490,0:22:56.740
and body

0:22:56.740,0:22:57.960
and then i would do the code

0:22:57.960,0:22:59.820
and have the results

0:22:59.820,0:23:02.720
and followed

0:23:02.720,0:23:04.990
with discussion

0:23:04.990,0:23:10.010
uh...

0:23:10.010,0:23:12.750
so this is a nice um...

0:23:12.750,0:23:17.760
why i've he's results

0:23:17.760,0:23:21.289
so those are some of the ways you can
run python and there's also python but

0:23:21.289,0:23:24.080
in a number of different places that you
might run into you

0:23:24.080,0:23:28.550
those places include such as uh... arc
g_i_s_ soccer arc info

0:23:28.550,0:23:31.420
for those of us we're stuck with the old
name in our heads

0:23:31.420,0:23:37.780
and across different tools that embed
python inside at their depressing

0:23:37.780,0:23:41.680
that's it for today thank you for
joining and uh... before tomorrow comes
