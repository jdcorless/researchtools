0:00:01.140,0:00:04.670
Hello.  My name is Kurt Schwehr and I'll
be showing you the emacs

0:00:04.670,0:00:06.880
text editor

0:00:06.880,0:00:10.359
Now, emacs is more than just a text editor.
It's a

0:00:10.359,0:00:15.519
full environment for all sorts of text
manipulation tasks including

0:00:15.519,0:00:18.250
programming and managing

0:00:18.250,0:00:21.180
projects and other tasks

0:00:21.180,0:00:26.529
So, today I would like to give you an overview of
how to use emacs using just the keyboard

0:00:26.529,0:00:29.899
so we're gonna avoid using mouse
at all

0:00:29.899,0:00:31.550
so put your mouse aside

0:00:31.550,0:00:32.940
and follow along.

0:00:32.940,0:00:38.390
You'll get a sense of how do you use basic
keyboard strokes to control

0:00:38.390,0:00:39.950
emacs

0:00:39.950,0:00:41.979
now what you're seeing right here is

0:00:41.979,0:00:45.870
Ubuntu Linux running GNU
emacs

0:00:45.870,0:00:50.170
Now if you're using a Mac or Windows
it'll look slightly different

0:00:50.170,0:00:54.520
but the keys should all be pretty much
the same

0:00:54.520,0:00:57.760
so the first key thing to know is that

0:00:57.760,0:01:04.500
emacs works off of the control and
meta keys. Now when you type control, and you are going to see a

0:01:04.500,0:01:06.760
C dash something or other,

0:01:06.760,0:01:11.330
that means hold down the control key and
then press a letter at the same time

0:01:11.330,0:01:13.770
So I am going to teach you a number of

0:01:13.770,0:01:16.040
control keys and meta keys today

0:01:16.040,0:01:19.130
the first one is control "g" which is
quit

0:01:19.130,0:01:22.299
so hold down control compress the
letter g

0:01:22.299,0:01:24.240
and you'll actually see at the bottom

0:01:24.240,0:01:25.330
down here

0:01:25.330,0:01:29.240
uh... quit in what's called the
mini-buffer

0:01:29.240,0:01:33.270
and in now emacs this is the status window
for what's going on in emacs

0:01:33.270,0:01:37.090
this will be the file name or what
generally you're looking at

0:01:37.090,0:01:39.360
this is how much of it you're seeing

0:01:39.360,0:01:41.480
and this is the line number you're on

0:01:41.480,0:01:43.569
now where it says fundamental

0:01:43.569,0:01:46.400
this will actually display the mode of what
we are in

0:01:46.400,0:01:50.820
whether it's text, a programming language or
something else

0:01:50.820,0:01:54.439
On the left, when we see two percent signs
that means it's not something we can

0:01:54.439,0:01:56.180
edit

0:01:56.180,0:01:57.200
now let's

0:01:57.200,0:02:01.340
learn a first keystroke which is
super important after a quit and that's

0:02:01.340,0:02:03.460
exit in case you're stuck in here

0:02:03.460,0:02:05.590
so that's control "x"

0:02:05.590,0:02:08.929
so you will now see a "C" dash "x" in the bottom left

0:02:08.929,0:02:11.290
and i'm not going to type it because
it will exit

0:02:11.290,0:02:14.379
control c after that would then exit

0:02:14.379,0:02:18.790
Now I'm going to use control "g" to quit that
or it now says undefined and control g

0:02:18.790,0:02:21.429
you're back to where we were

0:02:21.429,0:02:26.119
the next keyboard stroke that I would like to show you
is how to open or

0:02:26.119,0:02:31.139
visit a file as it is called in emacs so
that's control X

0:02:31.139,0:02:34.629
may see the C-x at the bottom here

0:02:34.629,0:02:37.889
and control F.  And now it's going to say

0:02:37.889,0:02:39.979
find file

0:02:39.979,0:02:43.489
it's going to prompt you for where on
the computer it's going to be looking

0:02:43.489,0:02:45.949
for the file.

0:02:45.949,0:02:50.540
Emacs has a helper called but TAB key on
the left of your keyboard.  If you press

0:02:50.540,0:02:51.989
that

0:02:51.989,0:02:55.559
it tries to complete what ever it can if
you give it a partial and it will

0:02:55.559,0:02:57.259
keep going

0:02:57.259,0:03:00.519
and if it doesn't know what you're doing, it
will starts showing you options

0:03:00.519,0:03:04.799
and they'll appear up here above
that

0:03:04.799,0:03:07.069
so let's go ahead and open up

0:03:07.069,0:03:09.319
a hello

0:03:09.319,0:03:14.209
world.txt file.  so just some text
file

0:03:14.209,0:03:15.829
and

0:03:15.829,0:03:17.419
in that file

0:03:17.419,0:03:19.329
let's go ahead and

0:03:19.329,0:03:23.099
learn how to save it.  So there's nothing in
our text file right now.

0:03:23.099,0:03:27.609
At the bottom it says we are at
line one and we are in text mode here.

0:03:27.609,0:03:29.660
So let's save it.  And the keyboard

0:03:29.660,0:03:34.079
command for saving a file is control X
control S

0:03:34.079,0:03:35.749
so there we have written

0:03:35.749,0:03:39.629
helloworld.txt to our home
directory.

0:03:39.629,0:03:40.609
Now if we want

0:03:40.609,0:03:45.129
to no longer edit that file, we can do
what is called "kill the buffer."  So buffers

0:03:45.129,0:03:49.259
are views into files.  So by killing the
buffer, we're not actually killing the

0:03:49.259,0:03:50.589
file.

0:03:50.589,0:03:53.459
And that's done by control X and the 
letter

0:03:53.459,0:03:55.709
K by itself.

0:03:55.709,0:03:57.259
And here it's going to

0:03:57.259,0:04:00.749
give us an option to do other buffers if
we wanted to, but

0:04:00.749,0:04:02.869
the default is the one that you're on
and on.

0:04:02.869,0:04:06.840
In this case, it's our helloworld.txt
buffer representing the file

0:04:06.840,0:04:08.150
helloworld.txt.

0:04:08.150,0:04:09.699
If i pressed enter,

0:04:09.699,0:04:14.289
the buffer goes away and we are back
to the home screen.

0:04:14.289,0:04:18.379
Okay.  So let's reopen

0:04:18.379,0:04:19.749
helloworld.txt

0:04:19.749,0:04:22.660
So, I did a control X

0:04:22.660,0:04:25.250
and control F

0:04:25.250,0:04:28.320
and then I typed helloworld.txt.

0:04:28.320,0:04:30.280
We're back to our empty file.

0:04:30.280,0:04:32.150
And I'm going to quit just write in

0:04:32.150,0:04:35.509
the commands that we've done so far. So control
G

0:04:35.509,0:04:37.280
is quit

0:04:37.280,0:04:39.999
Control X

0:04:39.999,0:04:43.959
controls C is exit

0:04:43.959,0:04:44.960
and

0:04:44.960,0:04:47.600
Control X control F

0:04:47.600,0:04:50.530
is opend slash

0:04:50.530,0:04:52.990
visit in quotes

0:04:52.990,0:04:55.020
is visit a file.

0:04:55.020,0:04:57.889
And control X K is

0:04:57.889,0:05:00.959
kill the buffer

0:05:00.959,0:05:05.210
representing a file.

0:05:05.210,0:05:06.389
And that's

0:05:06.389,0:05:09.080
not deleting

0:05:09.080,0:05:11.689
a file.

0:05:11.689,0:05:15.309
So let's learn about keyboard motions.
So far, I've just been typing in pressing

0:05:15.309,0:05:16.479
enter

0:05:16.479,0:05:20.289
and now you can use the arrow keys to go
up and down, left and right

0:05:20.289,0:05:23.550
just like you would in any other text editor.

0:05:23.550,0:05:25.999
But, emacs also has some shortcuts.

0:05:25.999,0:05:28.600
So let's go through those. To move around.

0:05:28.600,0:05:30.650
So I'm going to put myself in the middle here.

0:05:30.650,0:05:31.879
To go forward

0:05:31.879,0:05:34.389
is control F.

0:05:34.389,0:05:37.699
So you won't see anything.  It just moves the
cursor forward.

0:05:37.699,0:05:40.909
Control F is move

0:05:40.909,0:05:45.219
forward one character.

0:05:45.219,0:05:49.249
And there is a corresponding B for move back.

0:05:49.249,0:05:56.080
So if we do control B to keep moving
back and it keep wrapping around lines.

0:05:56.080,0:05:57.500
Now if we also have

0:05:57.500,0:06:00.319
the meta key.  Let's introduce that.

0:06:00.319,0:06:02.839
And that's written as M and then a
letter

0:06:02.839,0:06:04.979
So if we do M f

0:06:04.979,0:06:06.389
is move

0:06:06.389,0:06:07.809
forward

0:06:07.809,0:06:10.050
one word.  So I am going to

0:06:10.050,0:06:11.299
move up here.

0:06:11.299,0:06:13.569
We are going to jump forward by one word.

0:06:13.569,0:06:17.939
There are two ways to do this. The first
way is to press the escape key in the top left of

0:06:17.939,0:06:19.969
your keyboard.

0:06:19.969,0:06:23.479
now at the bottom here you should see an
escape appear

0:06:23.479,0:06:24.529
and

0:06:24.529,0:06:28.169
now it's ready to take that meta character.  I
am going to press F

0:06:28.169,0:06:30.309
If you saw that, we jumped from

0:06:30.309,0:06:32.810
the beginning of "forward" to the end of
"forward"

0:06:32.810,0:06:34.969
The other way to do the meta key

0:06:34.969,0:06:35.669
is,

0:06:35.669,0:06:42.039
on a Dell keyboard or standard PC, usually
the alt key.  So you press and hold the alt key

0:06:42.039,0:06:44.809
and then pressed the letter F and you will go forward.

0:06:44.809,0:06:46.979
This is the same on the mac

0:06:46.979,0:06:52.799
and windows, it may also be
the alt.

0:06:52.799,0:06:59.799
Okay. So that's forward by one word and there is a
corresponding meta b move back one

0:07:00.129,0:07:01.199
word.

0:07:01.199,0:07:04.149
So if I hold down the meta key and I keep pressing 

0:07:04.149,0:07:07.680
B, we moved back by one word.

0:07:07.680,0:07:09.240
To delete a character,

0:07:09.240,0:07:11.409
that's controlled d.

0:07:11.409,0:07:13.139
So if i type a bunch of stuff

0:07:13.139,0:07:17.819
and we press control d, that stuff will
disappear.

0:07:17.819,0:07:18.680
Delete

0:07:18.680,0:07:20.150
a character.

0:07:20.150,0:07:22.309
So when you are at the point

0:07:22.309,0:07:27.549
So if I put it on the first letter "a".  If we have 2 letter a's,
I press and hold control and

0:07:27.549,0:07:33.419
the letter "d" removes what's right on the cursor.
Okay.

0:07:33.419,0:07:34.949
And...

0:07:34.949,0:07:39.839
We also have a d character that's
delete a word.

0:07:39.839,0:07:41.589
So if I put this

0:07:41.589,0:07:43.909
right here at the beginning,

0:07:43.909,0:07:47.889
and I do a meta d.  So that's an escape


0:07:47.889,0:07:49.370
and the letter "d"

0:07:49.370,0:07:51.110
the word is gone.

0:07:51.110,0:07:53.930
To go with that, let me teach you the
undo.

0:07:53.930,0:07:56.110
So hold down control

0:07:56.110,0:08:00.240
and it's actually underscore so it's a
shift and where the minus key is up in the

0:08:00.240,0:08:01.899
top right of the keyboard.

0:08:01.899,0:08:03.910
So this will be control

0:08:03.910,0:08:07.050
underscore and that will undo the last thing.

0:08:07.050,0:08:08.449
And it can actually

0:08:08.449,0:08:10.859
undo a whole bunch of stuff.

0:08:10.859,0:08:15.349
It's a very big buffer so can go
back quite a ways.

0:08:15.349,0:08:16.320
So, "c"

0:08:16.320,0:08:18.550
and the underscore

0:08:18.550,0:08:19.629
is

0:08:19.629,0:08:23.169
undo.

0:08:23.169,0:08:24.009
Alright.  So

0:08:24.009,0:08:26.019
let's do a little more motion here.

0:08:26.019,0:08:29.020
Ah.  If we to control "p",

0:08:29.020,0:08:31.060
that's the previous

0:08:31.060,0:08:32.580
line

0:08:32.580,0:08:36.920
otherwise known as up.  so control "p" is going up.
Which is the same as using the arrow

0:08:36.920,0:08:40.120
keys.

0:08:40.120,0:08:43.240
C n is next line

0:08:43.240,0:08:44.850
or down.

0:08:44.850,0:08:47.490
So we can do

0:08:47.490,0:08:51.830
a control and an "n" we go down.

0:08:51.830,0:08:53.990
Now there are some really handy ones

0:08:53.990,0:08:55.570
control "a"

0:08:55.570,0:08:59.020
move to the beginning

0:08:59.020,0:09:02.360
of a line.

0:09:02.360,0:09:03.710
And C e

0:09:03.710,0:09:08.940
move to the end of the line

0:09:08.940,0:09:12.210
so if I type a control "a"
I go to the beginning of this line and

0:09:12.210,0:09:14.870
control "e", I go to the end.

0:09:14.870,0:09:17.980
You'll find those keys are very helpful
in the terminal in addition to being

0:09:17.980,0:09:20.380
in here in emacs

0:09:20.380,0:09:23.750
so a lot of these keys are directly
mapped the bash shell we've be talking

0:09:23.750,0:09:27.100
about in the research tools course.

0:09:27.100,0:09:29.230
Okay. So more motion.

0:09:29.230,0:09:33.030
Let's do some ones that move a lot
farther.  So control 

0:09:33.030,0:09:35.009
Sorry.  Excuse me.  The meta

0:09:35.009,0:09:37.650
less than

0:09:37.650,0:09:40.280
is the beginning of the buffer.

0:09:40.280,0:09:43.970
So if I press escape and then I do a
less than.

0:09:43.970,0:09:46.890
So you will see the escape here down on the bottom
left

0:09:46.890,0:09:48.980
We'll do a less than

0:09:48.980,0:09:55.250
and the cursor, or in emacs speak that's the
point, is move to the beginning of the file.

0:09:55.250,0:09:56.880
Now if we do you

0:09:56.880,0:09:58.040
meta

0:09:58.040,0:09:59.160
greater than,

0:09:59.160,0:10:02.130
that's the end of the file.

0:10:02.130,0:10:07.850
So again, escape less than goes to the beginning of the file.
Escape greater than goes to the 

0:10:07.850,0:10:13.250
bottom.

0:10:13.250,0:10:18.180
We can also do page jumps.  So if we do a 
control v

0:10:18.180,0:10:20.620
that's page down

0:10:20.620,0:10:22.360
and

0:10:22.360,0:10:25.000
meta v

0:10:25.000,0:10:29.000
is page up. So that would be an escape and then v

0:10:29.000,0:10:31.270
as in victor.

0:10:31.270,0:10:34.800
Those keys, if we typed them right now
nothing happens

0:10:34.800,0:10:41.800
because we have everything on one page
and so we can't see anything.

0:10:42.820,0:10:46.560
So let's have a little fun with
manipulating the display so that we can

0:10:46.560,0:10:50.560
see more text.  Then we can try those page
page up and page downs.

0:10:50.560,0:10:52.510
We can split the window

0:10:52.510,0:10:56.380
in different ways within emacs.  We can either
view multiple files

0:10:56.380,0:11:00.130
at the same time or the same file in
different places.

0:11:00.130,0:11:03.350
So let's learn how to split this.

0:11:03.350,0:11:05.460
And that first key is control x

0:11:05.460,0:11:06.820
2.  And this will split

0:11:06.820,0:11:08.650
uh... top to bottom

0:11:08.650,0:11:11.630
So we'll do a control x and then a 2

0:11:11.630,0:11:16.550
and now we have the same file viewed on both
the bottom and the top.

0:11:16.550,0:11:20.530
Now to jump between the two views, we
have control x

0:11:20.530,0:11:22.480
and the letter o

0:11:22.480,0:11:24.190
for other.

0:11:24.190,0:11:27.850
So this would be split

0:11:27.850,0:11:29.140
top bottom

0:11:29.140,0:11:31.160
for control x two.

0:11:31.160,0:11:34.750
And go to the other window for

0:11:34.750,0:11:38.070
control x o.

0:11:38.070,0:11:40.900
So let's go ahead and do a control x

0:11:40.900,0:11:44.000
and the letter o.  We jump to the other side.

0:11:44.000,0:11:46.780
Control x o and we jump back up to the top.

0:11:46.780,0:11:52.710
We can also split left to right.
So control x 3

0:11:52.710,0:11:54.290
split

0:11:54.290,0:11:55.799
left right.

0:11:55.799,0:11:57.570
So we can split

0:11:57.570,0:12:01.760
the control x and the number three by itself.
And then we have one

0:12:01.760,0:12:03.460
split left to right.

0:12:03.460,0:12:06.710
And if we do control x o to jump to the
other

0:12:06.710,0:12:08.580
we jump to the right

0:12:08.580,0:12:11.540
and then control x o and we are now at the
bottom.

0:12:11.540,0:12:16.720
One more time for the last one.  We jump
right back to the beginning.

0:12:16.720,0:12:21.390
Now, this can get really annoying.  So let's
do a control x 1 and that's

0:12:21.390,0:12:21.899
remove

0:12:21.899,0:12:25.640
move everything else.  Control x 1

0:12:25.640,0:12:27.860
remove all

0:12:27.860,0:12:29.630
windows.

0:12:29.630,0:12:33.230
Simplify life.

0:12:33.230,0:12:36.329
Let's go back up here real quick and
we'll look at

0:12:36.329,0:12:37.510
another thing.

0:12:37.510,0:12:38.640
Control

0:12:38.640,0:12:41.850
l is going to center

0:12:41.850,0:12:44.440
the screen and redraw it

0:12:44.440,0:12:48.850
at where the cursor is to be right in the
middle.  So I'm going to press control l

0:12:48.850,0:12:49.759
and now

0:12:49.759,0:12:52.320
that line is right in the middle of the
screen.

0:12:52.320,0:12:55.860
So that tends to help you focus
everything or if somehow the screen

0:12:55.860,0:12:58.160
got messed up, you can redraw.

0:12:58.160,0:13:01.320
So let's split. Control x 2.

0:13:01.320,0:13:04.490
And we now have two displays so that they are
narrower and we actually do you need to

0:13:04.490,0:13:06.200
page up and page down.

0:13:06.200,0:13:07.819
So let's try that.

0:13:07.819,0:13:11.100
Paging up.  So hold down the alt key

0:13:11.100,0:13:14.040
and press the letters v as in victor.

0:13:14.040,0:13:16.660
And we go up!

0:13:16.660,0:13:18.530
So if you see that, we've done

0:13:18.530,0:13:21.850
meta v. So hold down alt and press v.

0:13:21.850,0:13:26.190
If we keep doing it, we get to being in the
beginning of the file.  Now if we press control v,

0:13:26.190,0:13:28.660
we start going down in the file.

0:13:28.660,0:13:32.520
So we've now done these two commands:
control v and meta v.  Page up and

0:13:32.520,0:13:34.860
page down.

0:13:34.860,0:13:38.640
So this is annoying me to have two split
windows so I'm going to do control x

0:13:38.640,0:13:41.520
0 and we're now back to this in the single
window.

0:13:41.520,0:13:46.350
And we'll keep moving on with a few more
commands.

0:13:46.350,0:13:50.140
The next thing we need to do is we need
to search.

0:13:50.140,0:13:53.620
It's always good to be able find things as
you files get bigger you'll be looking

0:13:53.620,0:13:56.080
for stuff to either edit or to read.

0:13:56.080,0:14:02.370
And search is done with control s text.

0:14:02.370,0:14:04.720
So this is search.

0:14:04.720,0:14:08.710
And if you type the text lower case, your
search is going to be

0:14:08.710,0:14:14.310
case insensitive.  It won't care what
case it is.

0:14:14.310,0:14:17.780
If you do anything with a capital letter,

0:14:17.780,0:14:20.760
you get case sensitive

0:14:20.760,0:14:22.680
search.

0:14:22.680,0:14:26.880
And it will do a progressive search as we go.
So move the cursor up before search.  We'll type

0:14:26.880,0:14:28.360
control

0:14:28.360,0:14:29.480
s

0:14:29.480,0:14:33.010
and you now get this thing at the
bottom where it says I-search.

0:14:33.010,0:14:37.330
So we are now beginning the search.  As you 
start typing you'll see the match.

0:14:37.330,0:14:40.750
So start typing text slowly.  So you'll see t.

0:14:40.750,0:14:43.640
Now we've matched all the t's on the screen.

0:14:43.640,0:14:44.910
t e

0:14:44.910,0:14:47.120
And we had a few of those.

0:14:47.120,0:14:50.030
And then we type the x and t, we've 
now matched

0:14:50.030,0:14:52.830
two different "texts".

0:14:52.830,0:14:56.220
Now, when you are in the middle of a search,
there are two ways to get out of it.  One is

0:14:56.220,0:14:58.080
to just to move the cursor with

0:14:58.080,0:15:02.730
either the control keys or the arrow keys.
Or you can do a control g to get out of

0:15:02.730,0:15:05.480
your search and go back to where you started.

0:15:05.480,0:15:08.620
So there I just press a controlled g.

0:15:08.620,0:15:13.450
Now let's try that case-sensitive search.
So if I type control s,

0:15:13.450,0:15:14.980
press the letter t,

0:15:14.980,0:15:19.190
we've now found that first capital t

0:15:19.190,0:15:20.439
e x t

0:15:20.439,0:15:22.760
We've only got one.

0:15:22.760,0:15:27.100
So here I'm just go ahead and press
enter and we've now got the cursor at the

0:15:27.100,0:15:29.830
end of the match.

0:15:29.830,0:15:32.570
So let's try to search for text.

0:15:32.570,0:15:34.190
t e x t

0:15:34.190,0:15:37.500
Now, if we keep searching for it again we
want to keep her in the next instance,

0:15:37.500,0:15:41.250
we can just press control s again and it will find
the next one.

0:15:41.250,0:15:45.460
And when you get to the bottom and you
search again and there's nothing to find

0:15:45.460,0:15:47.269
it's gonna say failing search.

0:15:47.269,0:15:49.300
Now if you press control s

0:15:49.300,0:15:50.080
again,

0:15:50.080,0:15:53.530
it will go back to top of the file
and search down below.

0:15:53.530,0:15:56.560
So in this case it's just searched to the bottom,
jumps to be in the top

0:15:56.560,0:15:58.080
and

0:15:58.080,0:16:01.550
we've then been able to find the next one. So 
lets try a search that isn't here so it is more

0:16:01.550,0:16:03.779
more obviously that we jump back to top.

0:16:03.779,0:16:05.990
So if we say search.

0:16:05.990,0:16:09.940
And we will use file, which isn't being found.
It's up above us.

0:16:09.940,0:16:10.580
And we will 

0:16:10.580,0:16:14.570
press control s another time.  Control s
and we jump way up to the top of the

0:16:14.570,0:16:15.680
file.

0:16:15.680,0:16:17.530
And we're now at line 3.

0:16:17.530,0:16:21.740
We'll do a control s and jump to each of
the "file"'s as we go through it.

0:16:21.740,0:16:24.380
So you'll see me cycling through the whole

0:16:24.380,0:16:28.180
set of the words file in
this

0:16:28.180,0:16:31.470
document.

0:16:31.470,0:16:34.220
Now, I tend to do this just out of habit.  But
if you

0:16:34.220,0:16:35.040
remember,

0:16:35.040,0:16:36.370
search

0:16:36.370,0:16:43.100
or save was control x control s. And
that will save your document.

0:16:43.100,0:16:46.060
Alright. Now, let's do a little cut and
paste

0:16:46.060,0:16:47.360
and highlighting.

0:16:47.360,0:16:52.260
There's the first key you need to know is
control space bar.

0:16:52.260,0:16:55.140
And this is

0:16:55.140,0:16:57.040
start

0:16:57.040,0:16:58.620
or toggle

0:16:58.620,0:17:02.390
marking a region.

0:17:02.390,0:17:06.060
So this is like taking your mouse and
dragging it over an area.  So here I've got

0:17:06.060,0:17:07.500
my

0:17:07.500,0:17:11.709
cursor right on the beginning of the word start.
And hold down control and pressed the

0:17:11.709,0:17:13.280
space bar.

0:17:13.280,0:17:15.689
At the bottom, you will see "Mark set."

0:17:15.689,0:17:19.819
And now as I move the arrow keys you'll
see that I'm highlighting a region.

0:17:19.819,0:17:23.140
And controlled g and I'm out of that.

0:17:23.140,0:17:25.890
Or I can do control space

0:17:25.890,0:17:31.179
mark a region if I type controls space
again, it will un-mark that region.

0:17:31.179,0:17:33.110
Start a new one.

0:17:33.110,0:17:35.370
So we can do

0:17:35.370,0:17:40.929
control space. It will mark activate. control
space again.  Mark deactivated.

0:17:40.929,0:17:42.730
So let's

0:17:42.730,0:17:45.110
create some random text.

0:17:45.110,0:17:50.340
Very exciting text.  And will do a control
space and we'll back up here a little bit.

0:17:50.340,0:17:51.850
And the next command

0:17:51.850,0:17:57.000
is a copy a region. And that's meta w.
So I will press the escape key.

0:17:57.000,0:17:59.110
And then the letter w.

0:17:59.110,0:18:03.620
And it hasn't said too much, but it's copied
that into a little buffer.

0:18:03.620,0:18:04.480
And

0:18:04.480,0:18:06.299
let's mark that down.  So

0:18:06.299,0:18:10.539
meta w is copy.

0:18:10.539,0:18:14.940
And if I want to just paste that someplace,
the keys control y.

0:18:14.940,0:18:16.700
So

0:18:16.700,0:18:20.570
yank. That's C y

0:18:20.570,0:18:21.970
is yank.

0:18:21.970,0:18:24.309
Otherwise known as paste.  This was done

0:18:24.309,0:18:27.320
way before even Microsoft existed.

0:18:27.320,0:18:29.710
So the names don't necessarily follow

0:18:29.710,0:18:33.750
anything you'll see Microsoft or
the Macintosh.

0:18:33.750,0:18:36.370
Sometimes they are the same. Sometimes they are not.

0:18:36.370,0:18:38.010
There's also cut.

0:18:38.010,0:18:42.300
And that will be control w. And that's
cut. So we'll go up here.

0:18:42.300,0:18:45.590
I press control a to go to the
beginning of that.

0:18:45.590,0:18:52.090
Space to mark it. Go to the end and control
w. It's gone.  And now if I hit control y,

0:18:52.090,0:18:55.880
I pasted it right back in there.

0:18:55.880,0:19:00.570
There's another one which is really
useful. And that's to kill from

0:19:00.570,0:19:04.220
precursor to be the end of the line.  C k

0:19:04.220,0:19:08.190
and that kill to end of line.

0:19:08.190,0:19:11.030
So press control k to get rid
of this.

0:19:11.030,0:19:14.550
And everything from the that point on
to the end of the line is gone.

0:19:14.550,0:19:17.390
But it's been saved in that buffer.  So we
can go down

0:19:17.390,0:19:21.130
and we can paste it with a control y
at the bottom.

0:19:21.130,0:19:23.559
So control k was kill.

0:19:23.559,0:19:25.220
Meta w was copy.

0:19:25.220,0:19:27.050
Control w was cut.

0:19:27.050,0:19:30.710
Control y was yank or paste.

0:19:30.710,0:19:32.039
Now, if we.

0:19:32.039,0:19:34.930
Let's pick something else.  1 2 3 and

0:19:34.930,0:19:39.770
control a and we are going to do control k to
copy that.

0:19:39.770,0:19:42.660
And, say we want to paste that and we hit control
y.

0:19:42.660,0:19:43.950
And remember that we'd

0:19:43.950,0:19:46.500
saved a bunch of stuff before with
copying.

0:19:46.500,0:19:49.900
And maybe we want some of that back. So if you
don't touch anything else, but then you

0:19:49.900,0:19:51.990
go and you use the command

0:19:51.990,0:19:53.800
meta y,

0:19:53.800,0:19:54.980
instead of yanking,

0:19:54.980,0:19:59.220
in that spot again, what it will do
is go back one more in the

0:19:59.220,0:20:03.360
series of things that you copied and
pasted those in.  So if I

0:20:03.360,0:20:04.700
do a meta

0:20:04.700,0:20:08.159
y, it jumps back to the previous

0:20:08.159,0:20:11.850
copy. And meta y, if we keep going through it.  It will
jump back through all the different 

0:20:11.850,0:20:13.770
things I've copied.

0:20:13.770,0:20:18.610
Now I'm going to use the undo, because
that was not good.

0:20:18.610,0:20:22.160
And control l to get ourselves back to the middle.

0:20:22.160,0:20:23.670
And we are in

0:20:23.670,0:20:26.630
a good spot here.  So I've done control
space.

0:20:26.630,0:20:31.330
And I can also just hi delete on a 
region.  And unfortunately, nothing happened.

0:20:31.330,0:20:32.680
If your on

0:20:32.680,0:20:37.990
an Apple Macintosh, with aqua emacs, 
that will delete the region.

0:20:37.990,0:20:40.950
So let me save this.

0:20:40.950,0:20:42.410
And now,

0:20:42.410,0:20:45.430
what if we wanted to replace

0:20:45.430,0:20:46.360
something

0:20:46.360,0:20:49.930
that we didn't like?

0:20:49.930,0:20:51.010
There's a

0:20:51.010,0:20:53.820
thing called query replace where you can query.

0:20:53.820,0:20:58.600
It will ask you before each replace.  So you
can get type meta x

0:20:58.600,0:21:02.059
type query replace

0:21:02.059,0:21:03.440
and then it will

0:21:03.440,0:21:08.010
lets you replace a string.  So in this case,
I'm going to say s d

0:21:08.010,0:21:09.730
with some text

0:21:09.730,0:21:11.710
maybe some dashes.

0:21:11.710,0:21:13.039
Press enter.

0:21:13.039,0:21:17.290
It's gonna ask you yes or no for each
one.  So I am going to press the y

0:21:17.290,0:21:20.600
for yes.  n for no.

0:21:20.600,0:21:23.309
A space bar is also equivalent to yes.

0:21:23.309,0:21:26.270
So I'll hit another space bar.  A no.

0:21:26.270,0:21:27.780
A yes.

0:21:27.780,0:21:34.520
And we're done.  [cough]

0:21:34.520,0:21:36.340
So that was,

0:21:36.340,0:21:38.370
meta x query

0:21:38.370,0:21:40.030
replace.

0:21:40.030,0:21:45.800
Or you can also type meta percent.

0:21:45.800,0:21:48.980
So let's get rid of that.

0:21:48.980,0:21:51.910
Now, if I type Hello

0:21:51.910,0:21:53.750
Worldas

0:21:53.750,0:21:56.270
and I maybe misspell it,

0:21:56.270,0:21:57.320
there's a

0:21:57.320,0:21:59.230
keyboard shortcut for

0:21:59.230,0:22:01.580
spell checking.  So I can do

0:22:01.580,0:22:03.540
meta $.

0:22:03.540,0:22:05.039
So, let's see.  Meta

0:22:05.039,0:22:06.649
$ is

0:22:06.649,0:22:09.170
spell check

0:22:09.170,0:22:10.920
word.

0:22:10.920,0:22:13.040
So I'm going to type escape

0:22:13.040,0:22:14.840
and the dollar sign.

0:22:14.840,0:22:17.250
And it says, "I don't like this word."

0:22:17.250,0:22:21.600
Let's see.  And it gives me a bunch of options.  So
up to the top, it gives us a letter for

0:22:21.600,0:22:23.450
each of the different options.

0:22:23.450,0:22:27.929
It looks like number two is our option.
So I'll press the number 2.

0:22:27.929,0:22:32.630
And we now have the correct spelling of hello
worlds.

0:22:32.630,0:22:36.520
Now, in emacs, there's all kinds of extra
modes that can help you out.

0:22:36.520,0:22:39.080
In here, we have a snippet mode attached to this one
that we will not go into.

0:22:39.080,0:22:41.850
But let's add one 

0:22:41.850,0:22:43.500
and see if it's there

0:22:43.500,0:22:47.549
that will actually spell checking on the
fly. It's called fly-spell.

0:22:47.549,0:22:53.510
So we'll do a meta x.  And then we'll type out 
flyspell-mode

0:22:53.510,0:22:55.890
So let's give that a go.  So if I press escape

0:22:55.890,0:23:00.090
letter x, we go into the meta x mode
where we can type in lots of commands.  Are we will

0:23:00.090,0:23:02.680
doing much more of this.

0:23:02.680,0:23:03.980
And let's type fly

0:23:03.980,0:23:06.350
spell mode.

0:23:06.350,0:23:10.700
Now you'll see the word fly appear down
here after text.

0:23:10.700,0:23:13.830
if we typed hello

0:23:13.830,0:23:14.720
worldas,

0:23:14.720,0:23:17.530
it will now mark things as

0:23:17.530,0:23:20.410
misspelled.

0:23:20.410,0:23:24.420
and we can go through and say which one
we'd like to do.  I'm holding down

0:23:24.420,0:23:31.100
the equivalent of the right mouse button
on this computer.

0:23:31.100,0:23:32.730
Or you can you meta a dollar

0:23:32.730,0:23:35.420
and get the spell checking that way.

0:23:35.420,0:23:38.890
Hit 2 and you get "worlds."

0:23:38.890,0:23:42.660
Okay.  That's the first session of our emacs
tutorial using the keyboard

0:23:42.660,0:23:45.000
only for using emacs.

0:23:45.000,0:23:47.750
Feel free to use those menus up at the
top.

0:23:47.750,0:23:51.520
Click on them and hopefully if you're
using the right version of emacs that has actually

0:23:51.520,0:23:55.080
got the shortcuts, you can start learning
them from the menus.

0:23:55.080,0:23:58.330
Now, these menus will change as you switch
different types of files.

0:23:58.330,0:24:01.830
So don't be surprised if these don't always
look the same.

0:24:01.830,0:24:05.390
But, pay attention to various things in here.
For example,

0:24:05.390,0:24:07.600
if you want to create a shell,

0:24:07.600,0:24:09.400
or run the show command,

0:24:09.400,0:24:14.400
you could type ls.  And you now learn
that meta exclamation point or bang

0:24:14.400,0:24:17.299
runs a shell command.  So if we type ls,
there's now

0:24:17.299,0:24:18.409
an ls

0:24:18.409,0:24:22.330
in one of our little window here in emacs.
And a control x 1 will make that go

0:24:22.330,0:24:23.630
away.

0:24:23.630,0:24:24.700
That's it for today.

0:24:24.700,0:24:25.309
Thank you for watching!
