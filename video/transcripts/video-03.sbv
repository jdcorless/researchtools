0:00:01.939,0:00:03.179
i'm perched where

0:00:03.179,0:00:08.490
and says the third video for research
tools pat university entertainer for

0:00:08.490,0:00:11.909
coastal ocean mapping joint had terrific
center

0:00:11.909,0:00:13.839
in this video will be showing you

0:00:13.839,0:00:15.849
pemex org mode

0:00:15.849,0:00:19.269
a tool for note-taking to-do list
project planning

0:00:19.269,0:00:20.830
repeatable research

0:00:20.830,0:00:22.689
and many other such things

0:00:22.689,0:00:25.050
it's a really nice to land

0:00:25.050,0:00:28.869
unlike some other organizational system
that's completely plaintext so you can

0:00:28.869,0:00:30.179
always read

0:00:30.179,0:00:34.680
answered your notes even if you stop
using imax in the future

0:00:34.680,0:00:38.040
so let's take a quick look at uh...

0:00:38.040,0:00:39.640
what we have to do it

0:00:39.640,0:00:44.280
even acts that were closed so i'm a
start off by opening up if i don't

0:00:44.280,0:00:48.480
phoenix mccarty sample dot org

0:00:48.480,0:00:51.020
and now stars often org moment

0:00:51.020,0:00:53.270
and in workload

0:00:53.270,0:00:55.490
each entry starts with a start

0:00:55.490,0:01:00.550
it's very much like mca markup language
you might see like wikipedia's

0:01:00.550,0:01:04.500
and so this is a headline

0:01:04.500,0:01:06.750
and before we get too far into it

0:01:06.750,0:01:11.610
had just won a mention that if you have
are you going to an xbox you we'll have

0:01:11.610,0:01:14.330
to install its uh...

0:01:14.330,0:01:16.750
so if you want to install it

0:01:16.750,0:01:19.520
you'll most likely have to run something
like

0:01:19.520,0:01:25.330
sudo apt-get install org

0:01:25.330,0:01:28.990
now uh... or could be had historic

0:01:28.990,0:01:31.100
so once you've installed workmen

0:01:31.100,0:01:34.659
and we also have to do something really
quick here and that's

0:01:34.659,0:01:38.260
setup it dot imax

0:01:38.260,0:01:40.840
in a tiny max file actually controls

0:01:40.840,0:01:44.690
what imax does on start up an
interesting freddie forrest cuts and

0:01:44.690,0:01:47.190
that's what the women to with the
control x

0:01:47.190,0:01:48.350
to you

0:01:48.350,0:01:52.220
and in the mirror control x control have
to go open up

0:01:52.220,0:01:54.600
pataki max violent

0:01:54.600,0:01:57.579
now of course and this is a different
language you're probably used tubes has

0:01:57.579,0:02:00.830
written and out language called in
nationalist

0:02:00.830,0:02:05.570
you don't need to know if it other than
to copy this basic stuff

0:02:05.570,0:02:08.460
and then a few cases in cuba he met
final status

0:02:08.460,0:02:11.339
kilometer restart max

0:02:11.339,0:02:16.070
can listen watch he's got install or
node into imax

0:02:16.070,0:02:17.810
and that doesn't set up

0:02:17.810,0:02:20.250
worsening call or gravel that will
continue

0:02:20.250,0:02:23.829
headsets up some keyboard shortcuts that
car

0:02:23.829,0:02:25.589
it's a really defined

0:02:25.589,0:02:29.540
they have to do that a false that most
people use but you may need to other

0:02:29.540,0:02:30.900
commands if picture

0:02:30.900,0:02:34.759
having conflicts with others and actuals

0:02:34.759,0:02:38.889
so you'll be able to pay thing from the
mexico remote sites underneath the

0:02:38.889,0:02:43.299
install and deactivate section at their
manual

0:02:43.299,0:02:46.359
from the clothes that up with a control
access zero

0:02:46.359,0:02:47.930
and we're back to our

0:02:47.930,0:02:49.819
org wrote file

0:02:49.819,0:02:56.419
now inside of these headlines you could
actually have subsections so for example

0:02:56.419,0:02:58.489
had taxed

0:02:58.489,0:03:02.040
to filed

0:03:02.040,0:03:03.469
restart

0:03:03.469,0:03:04.219
imax

0:03:04.219,0:03:07.609
so now we have several different
sections in the city colors changing

0:03:07.609,0:03:09.689
the top level ones are doing

0:03:09.689,0:03:11.409
in this case the

0:03:11.409,0:03:13.219
second level ones are green

0:03:13.219,0:03:14.569
and you can have more

0:03:14.569,0:03:17.269
and number of levels

0:03:17.269,0:03:20.229
made very good

0:03:20.229,0:03:21.699
now free to these

0:03:21.699,0:03:25.429
there's a shortcut to you to be in class
denise to handle

0:03:25.429,0:03:28.989
basically being screwed now why in my
own and that's the top

0:03:28.989,0:03:32.129
so if you want to you

0:03:32.129,0:03:35.459
expand

0:03:35.459,0:03:38.849
collapse

0:03:38.849,0:03:42.929
your org mood tree

0:03:42.929,0:03:46.139
leave uh... tab

0:03:46.139,0:03:49.089
sify press tab on this one

0:03:49.089,0:03:53.169
you'll see that the very end the line
crazier there are three dogs replacement

0:03:53.169,0:03:56.319
repressed weekend

0:03:56.319,0:03:59.279
and uh... untreatable repair

0:03:59.279,0:04:01.500
they can do that for a couple will

0:04:01.500,0:04:03.119
one like them

0:04:03.119,0:04:04.839
and you can also

0:04:04.839,0:04:08.879
notice that when you are not when you
open back up you only see uh...

0:04:08.879,0:04:11.819
that's fallen trees that they'll be
collapsed too

0:04:11.819,0:04:17.229
you can't happen to those expand them

0:04:17.229,0:04:20.019
now i just hit shift tab

0:04:20.019,0:04:22.300
for the whole mischief ke impressed tab

0:04:22.300,0:04:24.610
that cycles pickle mobile

0:04:24.610,0:04:25.420
uh...

0:04:25.420,0:04:28.550
collapsing or expanding workman's home

0:04:28.550,0:04:30.289
shift

0:04:30.289,0:04:35.279
campuses in the new we haven't seen that
before simpson's

0:04:35.279,0:04:37.089
hands is

0:04:37.089,0:04:39.899
the shift key

0:04:39.899,0:04:43.770
sort of an unusual one you might not get
that with most of the programs

0:04:43.770,0:04:46.729
and just add that will

0:04:46.729,0:04:49.499
expand

0:04:49.499,0:04:51.830
and collapsed

0:04:51.830,0:04:54.349
all entries

0:04:54.349,0:04:56.680
now one thing i i do want to show you

0:04:56.680,0:05:03.610
pro quick before we go into more stuff
in the actually write text is

0:05:03.610,0:05:05.819
hammering bring out the top

0:05:05.819,0:05:09.619
pound plus startup colin and show all

0:05:09.619,0:05:11.020
if you do this

0:05:11.020,0:05:13.740
when you open up a new team axle work
file

0:05:13.740,0:05:17.889
this will all be showing if we close
this file and restart without that

0:05:17.889,0:05:20.089
you're going to see just be closed up

0:05:20.089,0:05:24.999
hasher p_m_ nodes at the top level so
you'll be missing must read it and it

0:05:24.999,0:05:28.860
camille disturbing me and i can use to
you're sending a studio

0:05:28.860,0:05:31.830
organ way of doing things

0:05:31.830,0:05:32.870
okay so let's

0:05:32.870,0:05:34.780
talk a little bit about

0:05:34.780,0:05:35.509
adding

0:05:35.509,0:05:37.889
taxed

0:05:37.889,0:05:40.159
if you can take whatever you want

0:05:40.159,0:05:42.610
polo world for example

0:05:42.610,0:05:43.770
but you can also do

0:05:43.770,0:05:45.430
i number of formatting

0:05:45.430,0:05:46.419
basics

0:05:46.419,0:05:48.120
you can

0:05:48.120,0:05:50.300
make

0:05:50.300,0:05:53.359
bold text by putting stars around it

0:05:53.359,0:05:55.169
or

0:05:55.169,0:05:57.189
if you put swatches

0:05:57.189,0:06:00.660
you get italics

0:06:00.660,0:06:03.780
or

0:06:03.780,0:06:05.909
underscores around it

0:06:05.909,0:06:08.979
underlying with underscores

0:06:08.979,0:06:12.919
one's a little hard to see there's
action underscore here and a nurse cora

0:06:12.919,0:06:16.050
here

0:06:16.050,0:06:18.379
and there's two other ones

0:06:18.379,0:06:20.680
uh... we use for the afternoon might
work and

0:06:20.680,0:06:25.309
man one is for a little code samples we
put equals around it

0:06:25.309,0:06:26.719
payens

0:06:26.719,0:06:32.379
for break

0:06:32.379,0:06:36.550
so it's not your signify preview here
but let's not to take a look at pat

0:06:36.550,0:06:40.080
howie max cordoba will actually
exporters to have

0:06:40.080,0:06:41.430
final project

0:06:41.430,0:06:45.250
for much of the families who are modem
actually just in work mode but

0:06:45.250,0:06:48.650
soften nice to be able to export
staffing for example the research tools

0:06:48.650,0:06:49.689
course

0:06:49.689,0:06:52.780
if you're looking at the web pages of
the record mode exported

0:06:52.780,0:06:56.900
html so what time of learn how to export
and that way you'll see what the

0:06:56.900,0:07:02.060
formatting is looking like

0:07:02.060,0:07:04.069
so the expert commands

0:07:04.069,0:07:08.870
attack appeared as controls c

0:07:08.870,0:07:12.599
control he

0:07:12.599,0:07:16.409
cannot really it's this manual of all
the different possible export formats

0:07:16.409,0:07:19.050
that are available

0:07:19.050,0:07:20.390
there's quite a few

0:07:20.390,0:07:25.050
but the ones were looking for actually
the exporting open in browser

0:07:25.050,0:07:28.479
this is the most convenient one for
working with html

0:07:28.479,0:07:33.009
femina go ahead and presby as in boy

0:07:33.009,0:07:35.210
and what that does is actually starts up

0:07:35.210,0:07:38.770
firefox

0:07:38.770,0:07:40.940
and you'll see here

0:07:40.940,0:07:43.370
power or blood flow

0:07:43.370,0:07:45.990
that's been exporting she now and you'll
see that

0:07:45.990,0:07:49.479
is exports that same directory were in
research tools has called it

0:07:49.479,0:07:53.899
example dot html samachar example dot
org

0:07:53.899,0:07:58.320
so you can see here in our section five
ad text we have our hello world

0:07:58.320,0:08:01.779
and we have bold italics underlying
coating for freedom

0:08:01.779,0:08:04.109
true verbatim what basically the same

0:08:04.109,0:08:05.569
they're not all that useful to you

0:08:05.569,0:08:08.919
just pick one particularly for cooking

0:08:08.919,0:08:13.509
kinkos that uh... progressing at two

0:08:13.509,0:08:18.059
and then so to control c control heat
and water b

0:08:18.059,0:08:20.949
mass export to html

0:08:20.949,0:08:25.020
and who've been and web

0:08:25.020,0:08:29.430
and our case that's firefox

0:08:29.430,0:08:33.610
now we can also great comments in here
so if you need to have comment things

0:08:33.610,0:08:36.750
out nato's yourself that are going to be
in the final product you can just put a

0:08:36.750,0:08:38.669
pound in the beginning of the line

0:08:38.669,0:08:41.290
and this is a comment

0:08:41.290,0:08:44.400
this has a

0:08:44.400,0:08:48.750
or if you haven't read that you don't
want to end up and then you can see

0:08:48.750,0:08:50.710
comment is the first word

0:08:50.710,0:08:53.400
and say do not

0:08:53.400,0:08:56.600
export yes

0:08:56.600,0:08:59.830
this

0:08:59.830,0:09:01.189
to this will

0:09:01.189,0:09:02.510
not

0:09:02.510,0:09:03.790
goes to you

0:09:03.790,0:09:06.910
html

0:09:06.910,0:09:08.389
so if we do a

0:09:08.389,0:09:09.500
control c

0:09:09.500,0:09:10.970
control he

0:09:10.970,0:09:12.730
and then could be

0:09:12.730,0:09:15.610
that was forty kenya and who are firefox

0:09:15.610,0:09:18.640
through the care was for all of the
bottom

0:09:18.640,0:09:22.430
you'll see section six comment and
there's nothing in it

0:09:22.430,0:09:24.220
he also knows as it goes up

0:09:24.220,0:09:26.360
we're getting a cable contents are free

0:09:26.360,0:09:30.200
so organized into my stuff or we can go
and say click on a particular section it

0:09:30.200,0:09:36.570
will take it tickets right there

0:09:36.570,0:09:39.220
now let's move on to less

0:09:39.220,0:09:41.340
listener creating that you can just

0:09:41.340,0:09:45.550
start typing them so we have a an entry

0:09:45.550,0:09:47.040
another entry

0:09:47.040,0:09:49.170
and you just put a dash at the beginning

0:09:49.170,0:09:51.660
myspace and then you should start taking

0:09:51.660,0:09:53.340
you can also have

0:09:53.340,0:09:57.570
sublets

0:09:57.570,0:10:01.880
another injury

0:10:01.880,0:10:05.330
now one thing you can also do as you can
highlight a region side and control

0:10:05.330,0:10:07.440
space to put the mark

0:10:07.440,0:10:08.480
moving up

0:10:08.480,0:10:11.689
and i just want to export this or not
looking at the whole document

0:10:11.689,0:10:13.670
you know i can type control c

0:10:13.670,0:10:14.790
throughly

0:10:14.790,0:10:17.630
maybe

0:10:17.630,0:10:21.570
tendency here every only got the section
with a list that

0:10:21.570,0:10:22.699
now the number two

0:10:22.699,0:10:26.229
be warned it is not going to match the
number of words and document so it's

0:10:26.229,0:10:28.590
going to reorder it mister one

0:10:28.590,0:10:30.330
but here you can see

0:10:30.330,0:10:32.200
we have to s

0:10:32.200,0:10:36.680
and manipulate primary list with the
simplest her

0:10:36.680,0:10:39.870
barricades fans here we can do it dashed

0:10:39.870,0:10:44.040
and to to square brackets with the
spacing between the space after

0:10:44.040,0:10:49.150
and it's is a to do

0:10:49.150,0:10:50.720
now you can turn on off

0:10:50.720,0:10:55.070
few items

0:10:55.070,0:10:58.160
he changed the state

0:10:58.160,0:11:00.530
for me to do

0:11:00.530,0:11:02.750
with control c

0:11:02.750,0:11:06.760
control seek clothes that whole control
c controls the

0:11:06.760,0:11:07.740
we now have

0:11:07.740,0:11:09.990
an x_-ray here on the left

0:11:09.990,0:11:13.670
and if you control c controls he again
has not done

0:11:13.670,0:11:16.850
in this way you can set up predefined
checklist of things you might need to do

0:11:16.850,0:11:21.230
for a task pasted into an working on
file and use it to track your task

0:11:21.230,0:11:26.580
through pickler

0:11:26.580,0:11:28.280
finished

0:11:28.280,0:11:31.370
task

0:11:31.370,0:11:33.060
hands

0:11:33.060,0:11:36.560
uh... capitalize

0:11:36.560,0:11:39.800
do you know i use

0:11:39.800,0:11:46.170
at lower case acts

0:11:46.170,0:11:48.760
heart rates plus a list

0:11:48.760,0:11:51.850
pretty easy

0:11:51.850,0:11:53.390
and um...

0:11:53.390,0:11:57.610
let's not talk about to deal items hands

0:11:57.610,0:11:59.040
pemex has

0:11:59.040,0:12:01.399
who way to handle workload

0:12:01.399,0:12:04.289
cities for a whole thing enough i
pressed shift

0:12:04.289,0:12:07.100
and at the rate peril

0:12:07.100,0:12:09.490
i can create had to do for them

0:12:09.490,0:12:11.459
so that was shift

0:12:11.459,0:12:13.880
and

0:12:13.880,0:12:16.750
carol

0:12:16.750,0:12:18.210
if i do it again

0:12:18.210,0:12:19.800
deals which it's done

0:12:19.800,0:12:24.220
and for him to pretend otherwise

0:12:24.220,0:12:25.630
creating

0:12:25.630,0:12:27.609
kidhu and done

0:12:27.609,0:12:32.240
items

0:12:32.240,0:12:33.420
he could also just type

0:12:33.420,0:12:36.190
tanner to do in their fair enough but
uh...

0:12:36.190,0:12:39.510
acutely previous to that was just read a
room

0:12:39.510,0:12:42.610
shifflett sterile

0:12:42.610,0:12:46.230
scroll through those and if you find
that those aren't enough for you

0:12:46.230,0:12:50.400
here's our ca wayne or go to actually
three other items like

0:12:50.400,0:12:52.050
dont started

0:12:52.050,0:12:55.410
to um... partially done finish like
totally don

0:12:55.410,0:12:57.920
i'm sick of it

0:12:57.920,0:12:59.810
okay

0:12:59.810,0:13:00.800
you can also u

0:13:00.800,0:13:03.390
whose control c

0:13:03.390,0:13:07.190
fropki grittier control c control t

0:13:07.190,0:13:09.980
are now done

0:13:09.980,0:13:13.189
now when we say that and we exported
control

0:13:13.189,0:13:16.330
t control key manatee

0:13:16.330,0:13:19.390
or firefox

0:13:19.390,0:13:22.550
and if we look at uh... don countries
will see a big

0:13:22.550,0:13:24.710
green done corp

0:13:24.710,0:13:29.010
are very big

0:13:29.010,0:13:32.010
great force talk about the in time

0:13:32.010,0:13:36.250
we're going to have a sense of dayton
time

0:13:36.250,0:13:42.520
unfortunately no time zone support

0:13:42.520,0:13:45.380
so everything is done in the local time
zone

0:13:45.380,0:13:47.890
you better know where you are when you
write this stuff

0:13:47.890,0:13:50.430
slightly problem for people on ships

0:13:50.430,0:13:53.460
but hopefully will come up with a good
strategy for that

0:13:53.460,0:13:55.079
to enter in time

0:13:55.079,0:13:59.010
you can do a control c and dont

0:13:59.010,0:14:04.070
canaveral insert a timestamp

0:14:04.070,0:14:05.630
so let's go ahead and do that

0:14:05.630,0:14:07.660
so controlled seat

0:14:07.660,0:14:11.230
and then the period or full stock

0:14:11.230,0:14:13.429
it's not just a few times dates

0:14:13.429,0:14:14.690
it's going to stay tuned

0:14:14.690,0:14:17.270
just the date and it's going let's pick

0:14:17.270,0:14:20.150
figure anything out of my can however or
something

0:14:20.150,0:14:21.430
and pick a date

0:14:21.430,0:14:26.000
but you're in the months around here so
i'll go ahead and take marin

0:14:26.000,0:14:28.710
as selling through this dayton time one
here

0:14:28.710,0:14:31.830
for custody without the com

0:14:31.830,0:14:33.770
uh... we can also change

0:14:33.770,0:14:34.730
the year

0:14:34.730,0:14:35.900
by calling

0:14:35.900,0:14:39.250
fit the year holding down the shift key
impressing up

0:14:39.250,0:14:41.920
will change the year by one year

0:14:41.920,0:14:44.440
people returned one thing you purchased

0:14:44.440,0:14:46.060
and corporate down

0:14:46.060,0:14:48.260
yields changed a month

0:14:48.260,0:14:52.810
and you can spend the day

0:14:52.810,0:14:55.280
shifts

0:14:55.280,0:15:00.850
or shift

0:15:00.850,0:15:03.700
change

0:15:03.700,0:15:04.610
plus

0:15:04.610,0:15:08.880
for minors

0:15:08.880,0:15:13.010
now oftentimes you actually want to have
the time without the way you do that is

0:15:13.010,0:15:16.900
controlling you control c

0:15:16.900,0:15:18.370
dot

0:15:18.370,0:15:19.910
let's go ahead and

0:15:19.910,0:15:22.160
insert

0:15:22.160,0:15:23.320
time

0:15:23.320,0:15:26.780
stamp with time not just eight

0:15:26.780,0:15:30.310
soviet control you controls c

0:15:30.310,0:15:32.380
and an appearance

0:15:32.380,0:15:35.350
and at the same thing but if you know
it's down here at the bottom

0:15:35.350,0:15:37.180
you'll actually see it i mean

0:15:37.180,0:15:39.060
forthrightness cantor

0:15:39.060,0:15:42.770
if you go to the time you can change
that uh... withholding on the shift

0:15:42.770,0:15:44.580
compressing the arrow keys

0:15:44.580,0:15:48.430
and notice on the mets insulin jump by
five so you can move around her

0:15:48.430,0:15:51.660
critically but if you want to do it
inside

0:15:51.660,0:15:58.660
five minute change you can just delete
that and but in the minute if you want

0:16:00.050,0:16:01.410
now

0:16:01.410,0:16:04.360
we can also do links

0:16:04.360,0:16:09.350
you can just put in a web links to is
she's yukiko one slash slash u_n_h_c_r_

0:16:09.350,0:16:11.240
do you

0:16:11.240,0:16:15.580
and in fact a common link

0:16:15.580,0:16:18.119
coaster firefox and taking a ride over

0:16:18.119,0:16:22.390
to the u_s_ webpage

0:16:22.390,0:16:25.030
if you want if you can actually

0:16:25.030,0:16:28.930
creat title for itself we uh... don't
want to see the whole well going back

0:16:28.930,0:16:30.400
and say

0:16:30.400,0:16:33.420
for example see contact going straight
to you

0:16:33.420,0:16:36.080
and they're used to square brackets

0:16:36.080,0:16:40.150
and then tolerate square racket plus
square bracket

0:16:40.150,0:16:43.519
and then on this part of your awash in
just a pin

0:16:43.519,0:16:46.450
secom and have to be our title

0:16:46.450,0:16:47.760
sold it

0:16:47.760,0:16:53.100
rate square brackets and i'm type one
more at square brackets and disappear

0:16:53.100,0:16:57.320
so now we have a link this just the text
of the one hand in there

0:16:57.320,0:17:02.700
and to the contrary to this week on my
page

0:17:02.700,0:17:05.480
now you can also do

0:17:05.480,0:17:06.880
control c

0:17:06.880,0:17:08.470
control

0:17:08.470,0:17:14.470
and that will let you attitude but this
at length of the kids that go control c

0:17:14.470,0:17:15.970
and prices at the bottom

0:17:15.970,0:17:17.329
right down here

0:17:17.329,0:17:19.350
and control

0:17:19.350,0:17:21.900
groups partly control c

0:17:21.900,0:17:23.459
control pal

0:17:23.459,0:17:26.590
and now it's going to try to link

0:17:26.590,0:17:30.380
so if we want to say

0:17:30.380,0:17:32.110
goodwill dot com

0:17:32.110,0:17:34.230
and change that to be cool

0:17:34.230,0:17:35.429
an inscription

0:17:35.429,0:17:38.210
and would have changed

0:17:38.210,0:17:42.100
turnout credo inc

0:17:42.100,0:17:44.120
malachi put links giri

0:17:44.120,0:17:50.910
in tax or were you want and you can make
it look how you so desire

0:17:50.910,0:17:55.090
uh... now we can also tag entries

0:17:55.090,0:17:58.250
and what is left to do

0:17:58.250,0:18:01.380
is that you can actually press control c
can

0:18:01.380,0:18:05.280
troll see very here and if you want to
start adding things

0:18:05.280,0:18:08.300
and you can go through these ties and
pull all the injuries and which occurred

0:18:08.300,0:18:09.809
had for example and i have a

0:18:09.809,0:18:12.020
tag in my notes called research

0:18:12.020,0:18:15.200
tools they use for this class

0:18:15.200,0:18:21.460
and perhaps teaching and in this case
were doing workload

0:18:21.460,0:18:23.860
now some very fighting with one pang

0:18:23.860,0:18:27.120
but if we make a second entry

0:18:27.120,0:18:31.070
second tagged

0:18:31.070,0:18:34.770
moment of controls the control c_n_n_
type already

0:18:34.770,0:18:38.870
and actually knows about her prior tags
and to help us

0:18:38.870,0:18:44.860
now if i make control c control see
again and see another one

0:18:44.860,0:18:48.549
uh... closest director for something

0:18:48.549,0:18:51.970
and now we have to tags that start with
the power

0:18:51.970,0:18:54.840
telustrator third one

0:18:54.840,0:18:56.880
third tagged

0:18:56.880,0:18:58.170
entry

0:18:58.170,0:19:00.240
control c control c tag it

0:19:00.240,0:19:02.289
protect hard-pressed tab

0:19:02.289,0:19:05.340
we get a completion list of all the
things that match

0:19:05.340,0:19:11.090
can arsenal hari and had packed right
now raster

0:19:11.090,0:19:12.980
they can also click on things

0:19:12.980,0:19:17.570
and it will help you go grab pat
anything matching those tags so if we

0:19:17.570,0:19:20.120
click here and

0:19:20.120,0:19:24.450
when these guys we cannot match in the
stands up

0:19:24.450,0:19:26.620
analyst research on

0:19:26.620,0:19:32.790
very center you can do all kinds of
reporting based on that

0:19:32.790,0:19:36.480
their system pretty fancy stuff that we
won't get in to go to the basics of

0:19:36.480,0:19:40.480
building tables

0:19:40.480,0:19:44.160
maidstone to table by pressing the
vertical bar

0:19:44.160,0:19:47.620
and we have column

0:19:47.620,0:19:50.450
and column

0:19:50.450,0:19:54.559
let's go ahead and do it export of this
region so we can see it

0:19:54.559,0:19:58.350
control c control he and i would be

0:19:58.350,0:20:01.760
and doesn't look like much yet

0:20:01.760,0:20:07.960
but here we've got column when a column
to and some parts of her

0:20:07.960,0:20:09.350
now if you want to put up

0:20:09.350,0:20:12.549
a line between entries decompress a
couple

0:20:12.549,0:20:16.210
dashes in depressed i'm here and now we
have a new table

0:20:16.210,0:20:18.460
that scott

0:20:18.460,0:20:20.080
pipeline

0:20:20.080,0:20:20.869
and uh...

0:20:20.869,0:20:24.240
saul fineman between its and we can type

0:20:24.240,0:20:28.530
some data

0:20:28.530,0:20:32.020
and uh... you know some numbers what
ever wanted to be answered ill keep

0:20:32.020,0:20:33.430
adding lines

0:20:33.430,0:20:34.560
and as you do

0:20:34.560,0:20:37.230
fill it up with stuff it looks pretty
horrible display

0:20:37.230,0:20:38.559
but if you press tab

0:20:38.559,0:20:42.200
it'll rebuild your cable make it very
nice

0:20:42.200,0:20:45.670
you can also do all kinds of math just
like you were in its own so you can do

0:20:45.670,0:20:49.580
reporting in this you can calculate
column sums and all sorts of

0:20:49.580,0:20:50.409
fancy

0:20:50.409,0:20:52.080
math tricks

0:20:52.080,0:20:55.830
so let's go ahead and export this home
to who've gone here

0:20:55.830,0:20:59.650
control c control key humanity

0:20:59.650,0:21:03.540
if you look here we have that for the
national armory here and we've got our

0:21:03.540,0:21:07.070
construct reports

0:21:07.070,0:21:10.690
now if you want to have one going around
thirty way to do that and

0:21:10.690,0:21:12.809
in the class council actually have

0:21:12.809,0:21:15.440
the line you can paste and read about er
told

0:21:15.440,0:21:22.440
to put solve lines around the entire
trick

0:21:24.530,0:21:28.780
now with code orgo is actually very
powerful in terms of dealing with cody

0:21:28.780,0:21:31.490
has a sub tool called the babble

0:21:31.490,0:21:33.500
that speaks many languages

0:21:33.500,0:21:37.169
and without weakens her saying things
like begin

0:21:37.169,0:21:38.300
stores

0:21:38.300,0:21:40.930
and estates for shell script

0:21:40.930,0:21:42.660
pound plus and

0:21:42.660,0:21:43.980
as a receipt

0:21:43.980,0:21:47.059
in there we can say fico

0:21:47.059,0:21:50.930
hello

0:21:50.930,0:21:53.370
and we now have a script

0:21:53.370,0:21:56.510
and if we export this

0:21:56.510,0:22:00.240
mickey amadee

0:22:00.240,0:22:05.820
helper nasa will block four th so we
have our code examples and blocks

0:22:05.820,0:22:07.570
but better yet

0:22:07.570,0:22:10.809
if i put my cursor in here

0:22:10.809,0:22:13.610
and i do you control c

0:22:13.610,0:22:15.990
control c

0:22:15.990,0:22:20.340
he asked me if i want to evaluate
running for committed say yes

0:22:20.340,0:22:23.360
and now comes the results hello world

0:22:23.360,0:22:28.210
so you can actually put working source
code inside of your remote file

0:22:28.210,0:22:30.090
and if we try to export the cinnamon

0:22:30.090,0:22:31.510
with a quick entry here

0:22:31.510,0:22:33.760
source

0:22:33.760,0:22:37.180
democrats control l two recent events

0:22:37.180,0:22:41.970
democratic control space move the arrow
keys down and now a highlight

0:22:41.970,0:22:43.520
that region and

0:22:43.520,0:22:45.530
powell put into it

0:22:45.530,0:22:46.340
you know

0:22:46.340,0:22:51.620
with detroit's control unit b

0:22:51.620,0:22:56.390
and unfortunately he didn't actually
show estimates hello world

0:22:56.390,0:22:59.820
so what we can do is we actually have to
sell its that we actually wanna see the

0:22:59.820,0:23:03.529
results in there and you could say
exports both

0:23:03.529,0:23:04.750
up here

0:23:04.750,0:23:08.580
and if we do a control c control see
again type yes

0:23:08.580,0:23:15.580
evaluated

0:23:17.640,0:23:19.490
tears again

0:23:19.490,0:23:20.560
statement

0:23:20.560,0:23:23.470
controls the control c type yes

0:23:23.470,0:23:26.049
within kingston pardon me for that

0:23:26.049,0:23:30.510
so it's a sport that control x control
the and the beach

0:23:30.510,0:23:35.679
and we don't need to run it now since
that's already run

0:23:35.679,0:23:37.080
and their comes or

0:23:37.080,0:23:42.290
mozilla firefox further hello world
written right in there

0:23:42.290,0:23:47.679
for this is the basis of why org mon
isn't excellent school for junior people

0:23:47.679,0:23:51.070
research because you can write your
report worrying here heavier excusable

0:23:51.070,0:23:53.799
code and the results altogether

0:23:53.799,0:23:56.669
this is often referred to as tangled
code

0:23:56.669,0:24:00.750
in net you've got your text description
in your code altogether

0:24:00.750,0:24:03.350
and you have one document the can either
be calm

0:24:03.350,0:24:06.910
p_b_s_ report or can actually be
calculating things in that it didn't

0:24:06.910,0:24:07.870
work

0:24:07.870,0:24:11.750
so let's do another one sample for
another language begin source

0:24:11.750,0:24:13.960
python

0:24:13.960,0:24:18.190
and will do it exports

0:24:18.190,0:24:23.040
what ended with a hand source

0:24:23.040,0:24:26.000
entitled as a slight difference intact
sole print

0:24:26.000,0:24:27.919
hello

0:24:27.919,0:24:29.679
world

0:24:29.679,0:24:31.670
payphone

0:24:31.670,0:24:35.370
went through an commons

0:24:35.370,0:24:36.649
and will go ahead

0:24:36.649,0:24:38.950
and highlight

0:24:38.950,0:24:40.330
this whole region

0:24:40.330,0:24:43.019
patrol spaces harp

0:24:43.019,0:24:46.330
analogy of controls he can truly buddy

0:24:46.330,0:24:48.250
will go ahead and romance

0:24:48.250,0:24:52.720
and more on this one too

0:24:52.720,0:24:55.640
now we have a slight problem here

0:24:55.640,0:24:57.820
we can expect to see not

0:24:57.820,0:25:02.070
so the way python works is actually the
motor placed on takes the return from

0:25:02.070,0:25:03.130
that

0:25:03.130,0:25:07.360
for commanders in quite a great we need
to change this to be

0:25:07.360,0:25:10.980
returned

0:25:10.980,0:25:13.250
poker hand controls he controls hero

0:25:13.250,0:25:14.710
not type yes

0:25:14.710,0:25:18.260
here are results tomorow

0:25:18.260,0:25:20.030
and so now

0:25:20.030,0:25:26.200
if we control space poet origin controls
he control the mandy

0:25:26.200,0:25:28.880
grad rerun it for fun

0:25:28.880,0:25:35.100
bring up firefox and there's a results
from paypal

0:25:35.100,0:25:37.110
ghost towns

0:25:37.110,0:25:39.679
okay so if you're in the research tools
course

0:25:39.679,0:25:43.899
for the rest of the semester one of your
assignment is to actually use workload

0:25:43.899,0:25:47.470
every day here in class to take at least
one note

0:25:47.470,0:25:51.830
and doubled agreeing on going through
and taking those every single day i'll

0:25:51.830,0:25:53.730
be looking your or good log

0:25:53.730,0:25:57.539
any idea here is that you should as a
scientist policy taking track

0:25:57.539,0:25:59.419
keeping track of what's going on

0:25:59.419,0:26:00.570
in your research

0:26:00.570,0:26:01.809
and this will give you

0:26:01.809,0:26:05.220
at least one way of doing it and have
you experience that you may not be the

0:26:05.220,0:26:06.590
way of u_n_ afflicted

0:26:06.590,0:26:07.670
thinking to do

0:26:07.670,0:26:08.780
but hopefully

0:26:08.780,0:26:11.480
will get you he's thinking about the
idea so here's how

0:26:11.480,0:26:15.860
i do it more like reinventing

0:26:15.860,0:26:17.890
are usually put a star for header

0:26:17.890,0:26:20.059
can i just read out the date that i want

0:26:20.059,0:26:21.500
or some comments

0:26:21.500,0:26:24.120
salts a say in september

0:26:24.120,0:26:26.620
twenty-fifth

0:26:26.620,0:26:28.650
nyu

0:26:28.650,0:26:32.490
interaction at the location here because
i travel fair bit and it's always

0:26:32.490,0:26:35.750
helpful to know or not

0:26:35.750,0:26:36.630
will do that

0:26:36.630,0:26:38.019
in is also a

0:26:38.019,0:26:40.710
controlled season in the period

0:26:40.710,0:26:44.270
and i will give me the date conjured
oppressed entered

0:26:44.270,0:26:47.360
another tag it as day

0:26:47.360,0:26:49.750
so control c control c

0:26:49.750,0:26:51.930
him and tagged etc

0:26:51.930,0:26:57.500
so that's major for the administration
tree during the day for example

0:26:57.500,0:27:00.790
uh... sitting

0:27:00.790,0:27:01.880
research

0:27:01.880,0:27:04.130
tools

0:27:04.130,0:27:06.510
today we talked

0:27:06.510,0:27:10.480
about

0:27:10.480,0:27:11.730
so that way

0:27:11.730,0:27:14.740
you'll have a an entry runs for for the
whole year

0:27:14.740,0:27:16.080
and uh...

0:27:16.080,0:27:19.100
dress this master and that way you can
see what's going on as you go to the

0:27:19.100,0:27:22.160
semester and you can track your you're
working as you figure out things that

0:27:22.160,0:27:23.590
may not be in the research

0:27:23.590,0:27:26.740
tools notes you can add your own notes
and be able to

0:27:26.740,0:27:28.919
sing together and match up to date

0:27:28.919,0:27:33.230
with the your notes and collection of
written

0:27:33.230,0:27:36.620
spoke with us and i get too excited
about the national guard loan i haven't

0:27:36.620,0:27:42.139
renewed even a small fraction of that
tools that are available inside of organ

0:27:42.139,0:27:43.340
but it does then provides

0:27:43.340,0:27:47.510
i'm very fancy way if you mix languages
and do all sorts of very exciting stuff

0:27:47.510,0:27:48.610
that's

0:27:48.610,0:27:51.620
are difficult in almost every other way

0:27:51.620,0:27:53.260
thanks very much first thing

0:27:53.260,0:27:53.820
and i'm for sure
