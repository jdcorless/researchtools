hello my name is cursed where and this
is research tools video eighteen

0:00:05.800,0:00:08.130
on place on it will be covering today

0:00:08.130,0:00:14.100
hdfc i'd using the eighty-five pile
ivory ban umpire library and matt public

0:00:14.100,0:00:15.559
library

0:00:15.559,0:00:19.789
and this is a class our research tools
for the u_n_ each center for coastal

0:00:19.789,0:00:22.519
ocean mapping join had rafiq center

0:00:22.519,0:00:26.259
let's go ahead and get started

0:00:26.259,0:00:28.699
it will be using the

0:00:28.699,0:00:33.239
that electric out to be a grade or bag
format as our civil suits today so let's

0:00:33.239,0:00:35.000
go ahead hands

0:00:35.000,0:00:37.670
first start off by

0:00:37.670,0:00:39.850
hinckley python going through

0:00:39.850,0:00:42.400
step by python and press enter

0:00:42.400,0:00:43.060
and

0:00:43.060,0:00:45.539
to make sure that we log everything that
were doing

0:00:45.539,0:00:49.770
we actually want to start up uh...
script called

0:00:49.770,0:00:53.540
magic function in anti-tank all-star
won't start

0:00:53.540,0:00:54.610
and making

0:00:54.610,0:00:58.560
either leave the percent on or we can
take it off

0:00:58.560,0:01:01.470
we can use a question mark at the end of
that to make sure that we can get some

0:01:01.470,0:01:05.730
help before easter up running in spencer

0:01:05.730,0:01:10.250
in here what first got a couple options
were a lot of her mum on so that we can

0:01:10.250,0:01:13.970
see as much as possible of what went on
with our session

0:01:13.970,0:01:16.120
sore and i want to you

0:01:16.120,0:01:18.080
give it all the options

0:01:18.080,0:01:20.670
preschool down here we can take a look
at them

0:01:20.670,0:01:25.490
the gastro auction says uh... we want
output

0:01:25.490,0:01:28.850
herb right to the output of by python
the results of the two are things in

0:01:28.850,0:01:30.590
there

0:01:30.590,0:01:36.270
dash or for a long run says log what we
tight sophie replaces things its kinda

0:01:36.270,0:01:37.820
not actually to you

0:01:37.820,0:01:41.510
some finest ever placing things like
this is the action which tape

0:01:41.510,0:01:46.509
and dash kiefer timestamps vacancies for
repression of things

0:01:46.509,0:01:49.130
now we also want it to you

0:01:49.130,0:01:52.619
use the log mode which is described here

0:01:52.619,0:01:57.040
and we actually want to use tend to be
sure that were not worrying so much fun

0:01:57.040,0:01:59.220
please go ahead and set that up

0:01:59.220,0:02:02.730
school say log start

0:02:02.730,0:02:03.450
role

0:02:03.450,0:02:04.539
past or

0:02:04.539,0:02:07.260
dash t the three options like

0:02:07.260,0:02:11.839
and now the following a rate of two so
video eighteen

0:02:11.839,0:02:14.180
logged up onto those socks here

0:02:14.180,0:02:19.609
almost from a multi-pronged script and
we want to append answer

0:02:19.609,0:02:24.560
and now it's told us that it's gone
ahead and set things up for us

0:02:24.560,0:02:26.699
and selling

0:02:26.699,0:02:28.149
to double check that

0:02:28.149,0:02:30.489
we can say

0:02:30.489,0:02:31.849
tell us that show

0:02:31.849,0:02:37.579
will see there's a video on file then we
can say bang serenity daschle scripts

0:02:37.579,0:02:39.400
command which has had

0:02:39.400,0:02:40.189
and

0:02:40.189,0:02:42.649
video pressed have

0:02:42.649,0:02:46.499
had answer and we can now see that could
start a blog

0:02:46.499,0:02:48.669
and it's now off and running

0:02:48.669,0:02:51.509
completely timestamps

0:02:51.509,0:02:55.449
so let's go ahead and pick up our data
from now on

0:02:55.449,0:03:00.719
so here i've got firefox running and
i've gone to the angie bc or national

0:03:00.719,0:03:02.539
geophysical data center

0:03:02.539,0:03:03.559
website

0:03:03.559,0:03:04.589
hands

0:03:04.589,0:03:07.939
what's here are different classes of
survey types

0:03:07.939,0:03:09.799
hands

0:03:09.799,0:03:12.729
and the one sister with each other
hydrographic surveys

0:03:12.729,0:03:15.649
so let's take a look and the newest had
traffic surveys

0:03:15.649,0:03:17.189
so it's been updated

0:03:17.189,0:03:19.649
october seventeenth

0:03:19.649,0:03:21.559
so not too long ago

0:03:21.559,0:03:22.510
in here

0:03:22.510,0:03:24.989
each one of these directories is a
survey

0:03:24.989,0:03:29.119
and once perot all the way down to the
bottom grabbed the newest

0:03:29.119,0:03:31.499
and let's go in the twelve

0:03:31.499,0:03:34.449
two seven nine treasury now if

0:03:34.449,0:03:38.059
you're reading this at a later date you
most likely will see a lot more surveys

0:03:38.059,0:03:41.939
in this directory and still have to go
find twelve two seven nine two following

0:03:41.939,0:03:43.810
exactly will be hiding in the middle

0:03:43.810,0:03:46.989
so pressed enter terrace right-click

0:03:46.989,0:03:48.609
now in this directory

0:03:48.609,0:03:51.929
there's going to be other things in
addition to bags there might be just

0:03:51.929,0:03:53.510
uh...

0:03:53.510,0:03:56.650
reports about what's going on in there
there might be

0:03:56.650,0:03:58.109
all sorts of other data

0:03:58.109,0:04:02.399
but let's go take a peek in finance dept
sand here there's a came our google or

0:04:02.399,0:04:06.759
file that you could take a look at for
where bottom tables were collected

0:04:06.759,0:04:09.759
and we're going to ask you look in the
bag directory

0:04:09.759,0:04:13.919
so in this particular survey there's
only one bag

0:04:13.919,0:04:18.019
the filing to mention that noah has
recently adopted starts off with the

0:04:18.019,0:04:19.340
survey number

0:04:19.340,0:04:21.089
and underscore

0:04:21.089,0:04:24.610
then the vb stands for vertical beam
which is

0:04:24.610,0:04:27.870
in our further vocabulary of might be
called single being

0:04:27.870,0:04:31.919
such as uh... so we're going straight
down and isn't a multi beam

0:04:31.919,0:04:34.899
for amnesty great cell size

0:04:34.899,0:04:36.050
so four meters

0:04:36.050,0:04:39.240
this is the vertical datum mean low low
water

0:04:39.240,0:04:45.189
and one of one says we only have one bag
if there were many might say one of ten

0:04:45.189,0:04:49.550
dot bags are format extension which is
just uh... convention

0:04:49.550,0:04:52.889
and then jeezy implies that it's
compressed

0:04:52.889,0:04:56.809
let's go ahead and copy the link self
control

0:04:56.809,0:04:59.729
or break click

0:04:59.729,0:05:02.529
copy link location

0:05:02.529,0:05:03.669
in a minute now

0:05:03.669,0:05:04.620
hide that

0:05:04.620,0:05:06.580
and we're going here in the state

0:05:06.580,0:05:12.310
interact type themselves they bank to go
back to shelve the defense

0:05:12.310,0:05:16.809
i'm gonna go ahead and paste in that you
are elm pressed enter

0:05:16.809,0:05:21.659
it's going to go grab archive file for
its the file size varies quite a bit so

0:05:21.659,0:05:25.969
if you take a different bag it may be
much larger take longer

0:05:25.969,0:05:30.360
wilson compress it will save banks are
emotional

0:05:30.360,0:05:33.099
g unzipped

0:05:33.099,0:05:35.249
and start dot you see

0:05:35.249,0:05:36.539
best answer

0:05:36.539,0:05:38.429
and tell us that show

0:05:38.429,0:05:42.459
shows us that we now have our log in we
have our bag that we're going to work

0:05:42.459,0:05:44.240
with

0:05:44.240,0:05:48.849
now high always do this just for safety
and so you can fall here on c_ if the

0:05:48.849,0:05:52.389
bag is the same one that i've downloaded

0:05:52.389,0:05:59.389
so struck by expecting a little shell
consistency file each one to you

0:05:59.619,0:06:05.349
and here we can see that it's a her
hierarchical data format or hdfc version

0:06:05.349,0:06:06.639
five

0:06:06.639,0:06:11.360
now phys ed version four does offer a
read that is not the same

0:06:11.360,0:06:13.499
the format changed fairly

0:06:13.499,0:06:16.229
drastically between four and five

0:06:16.229,0:06:20.979
and we can also then to bang mt five to
run

0:06:20.979,0:06:25.409
and have some during check someone that
file to make sure that we know what's

0:06:25.409,0:06:28.279
version we used so there's the check
some

0:06:28.279,0:06:31.279
and if the strike some has changed
between

0:06:31.279,0:06:33.949
why i did this and your version

0:06:33.949,0:06:35.699
then this cheap

0:06:35.699,0:06:39.719
most common proposal or things that
happened are

0:06:39.719,0:06:43.379
you've got a partial downloads of of you
only got a bit of the data

0:06:43.379,0:06:47.870
you can see my tax uh... filesize here
to see how big it is

0:06:47.870,0:06:49.560
nelson i make sure that uh...

0:06:49.560,0:06:51.900
jeezy at confirm for us

0:06:51.900,0:06:57.059
synergy june's that actually works and
there's no dot she's here for here

0:06:57.059,0:07:00.559
now the other thing that could happen is
that the files updated right now it's

0:07:00.559,0:07:01.439
time now

0:07:01.439,0:07:05.389
and that they didn't change the file
name him we now have a new filed with

0:07:05.389,0:07:09.179
different contents so if this is
different is very possible to change

0:07:09.179,0:07:13.580
something about that that you are not
facing the exact same day that i am

0:07:13.580,0:07:15.810
however faster case keep going

0:07:15.810,0:07:20.539
that is probably still good so give it a
go

0:07:20.539,0:07:24.259
erickson now let's go ahead and imports

0:07:24.259,0:07:26.000
each five pi

0:07:26.000,0:07:29.319
now if you don't have this coming in
here it fails

0:07:29.319,0:07:32.029
you can run the command

0:07:32.029,0:07:37.509
c_e_o_ abt get with the program to do it
controls the asbestos pain then we'll

0:07:37.509,0:07:39.099
tight clear

0:07:39.099,0:07:43.369
so controls the is the suit and he would
have jobs and you'll see there's one job

0:07:43.369,0:07:44.830
in the background

0:07:44.830,0:07:48.509
you could do a studio apt get install

0:07:48.509,0:07:53.449
and then you could say python dash huge
five pie

0:07:53.449,0:07:54.460
press center

0:07:54.460,0:07:57.539
now if they want the password in this
case it's playing

0:07:57.539,0:07:58.710
or estimation point

0:07:58.710,0:08:00.089
party

0:08:00.089,0:08:05.110
two thousand one one the emmy for using
super switching for cloths

0:08:05.110,0:08:08.319
now in this case you'll see that parry
have installed

0:08:08.319,0:08:11.029
so it didn't need to do anything its
authority

0:08:11.029,0:08:13.460
at the newest version

0:08:13.460,0:08:17.620
now if you've got a suspended job we
haven't seen this before so we're gonna

0:08:17.620,0:08:21.870
restart that job so we can say s_g_ for
foreground and i'll bring about the

0:08:21.870,0:08:23.740
format of the brady bill

0:08:23.740,0:08:27.389
now doesn't read rather screen so i
tended answer here just to see where we

0:08:27.389,0:08:27.990
are

0:08:27.990,0:08:29.979
needed type history

0:08:29.979,0:08:34.430
to get back to sense of where we are may
remember it's these are our magic a

0:08:34.430,0:08:37.530
means to get ron carey replace for some
funny

0:08:37.530,0:08:40.390
underscore right to use that you can
ignore it

0:08:40.390,0:08:42.900
so we've imported are

0:08:42.900,0:08:48.920
each five pi library him let's go ahead
and opened the bag five so bag equals

0:08:48.920,0:08:51.140
eight-five pod

0:08:51.140,0:08:53.160
period

0:08:53.160,0:08:54.190
hit tab

0:08:54.190,0:08:58.090
and you'll see the options that are
inside of

0:08:58.090,0:09:01.070
the bag top-level module

0:09:01.070,0:09:03.860
and what we want is the file one over
here

0:09:03.860,0:09:06.130
so file

0:09:06.130,0:09:07.190
and then

0:09:07.190,0:09:12.050
will do a single quote each one press
tab complete that out

0:09:12.050,0:09:15.000
and we've now opened up our bank five

0:09:15.000,0:09:15.849
so let's

0:09:15.849,0:09:17.720
take a little bit of a look at our bag

0:09:17.720,0:09:18.660
filled with hope

0:09:18.660,0:09:22.369
bheji period press that have key will
get the extension see some of the

0:09:22.369,0:09:23.420
options

0:09:23.420,0:09:25.440
camera use a couple of these

0:09:25.440,0:09:29.750
will start off by making sure we have
the right files will use file name

0:09:29.750,0:09:32.280
and lo and behold we have the right file

0:09:32.280,0:09:35.040
we can also then type name

0:09:35.040,0:09:40.260
and it's actually nine telus where we
are in the tree of the each tier five

0:09:40.260,0:09:43.190
now issue five files tend to look like

0:09:43.190,0:09:45.820
a file system inside of a file

0:09:45.820,0:09:48.149
sylvia came to access it that way

0:09:48.149,0:09:51.920
let's take a look at some of the other
options bagged up items

0:09:51.920,0:09:57.320
in there it tells us what's in this bag
and we see there's a palpable route and

0:09:57.320,0:09:58.649
called backwards

0:09:58.649,0:10:01.200
and it's got four members

0:10:01.200,0:10:02.410
not very helpful

0:10:02.410,0:10:05.930
uh... we can also try bag dot values

0:10:05.930,0:10:07.120
and in the air

0:10:07.120,0:10:10.430
it shows that there's a c f five group

0:10:10.430,0:10:12.080
with four members

0:10:12.080,0:10:14.300
so let's go ahead instead

0:10:14.300,0:10:16.410
bag dot items

0:10:16.410,0:10:22.350
and listening grabbing item

0:10:22.350,0:10:25.300
so we want me to look at that bag roots

0:10:25.300,0:10:29.590
so abortions gets very confusing this is
not the way i'd like to do it

0:10:29.590,0:10:32.950
but this will let zack says one of the
the bag group

0:10:32.950,0:10:37.060
and so this isn't what we're gonna do
you wear these it like the filesystem

0:10:37.060,0:10:39.110
and actually works

0:10:39.110,0:10:43.420
very much like aid

0:10:43.420,0:10:44.070
dictionary

0:10:44.070,0:10:45.140
so to save

0:10:45.140,0:10:49.940
bag roots

0:10:49.940,0:10:51.430
and that will get us the

0:10:51.430,0:10:52.500
the node

0:10:52.500,0:10:55.540
at backwards

0:10:55.540,0:10:58.340
then we can also say idm

0:10:58.340,0:11:01.380
in the mayor we see something as much
more interesting it looks nothing like

0:11:01.380,0:11:04.100
we have some data we have elevation

0:11:04.100,0:11:05.630
we have meditative

0:11:05.630,0:11:07.370
pay tracking list

0:11:07.370,0:11:09.120
and uncertainty

0:11:09.120,0:11:15.080
so let's go ahead and save our written
notes will say a route equals bag

0:11:15.080,0:11:18.580
and you can actually dot the slash
fifteen slash twenty top level

0:11:18.580,0:11:22.640
if you'd like so bag route

0:11:22.640,0:11:28.190
and if it's a type of roots and it shows
that it's an age five pi high-level hurt

0:11:28.190,0:11:31.050
whatever that means

0:11:31.050,0:11:35.580
so let's go ahead and take a look at
that roots will say words dot name

0:11:35.580,0:11:38.540
and we see that where it is in the tree
basically

0:11:38.540,0:11:40.800
but they also say roots dot

0:11:40.800,0:11:42.700
parent

0:11:42.700,0:11:47.900
and it shows is the parent is flash from
the top level

0:11:47.900,0:11:49.700
rights with new routes dot

0:11:49.700,0:11:51.230
items

0:11:51.230,0:11:53.509
and it shows us what we saw before with
our

0:11:53.509,0:11:55.110
major items

0:11:55.110,0:11:57.520
and we'll be looking next

0:11:57.520,0:12:03.050
at meditative source to roots dot values
before a move on

0:12:03.050,0:12:07.710
and we can see over type so we're gonna
be looking at meditating here

0:12:07.710,0:12:11.440
and if it's a little bit funky because
of the standard vote

0:12:11.440,0:12:13.690
as it is for bags right now

0:12:13.690,0:12:14.310
what is it

0:12:14.310,0:12:15.740
incinerated

0:12:15.740,0:12:16.760
of

0:12:16.760,0:12:19.060
strings that are one character long

0:12:19.060,0:12:22.830
surround them being a string of ampex
characters its

0:12:22.830,0:12:27.150
a whole bunch of a raise of one string
to little awkward shall we say

0:12:27.150,0:12:30.910
and unfortunately that's the way series
right now and so we can have to live

0:12:30.910,0:12:32.120
with it

0:12:32.120,0:12:35.900
but it isn't that bad since for in
python and were able to manipulate stuff

0:12:35.900,0:12:37.490
pretty well

0:12:37.490,0:12:42.170
so we can actually go and grab that made
it out and start ramya turning to you

0:12:42.170,0:12:45.090
tax of it and look at to read about our
data

0:12:45.090,0:12:46.840
so we can say

0:12:46.840,0:12:48.160
meadow data

0:12:48.160,0:12:50.340
node

0:12:50.340,0:12:51.540
equals

0:12:51.540,0:12:52.370
and

0:12:52.370,0:12:54.020
route

0:12:54.020,0:12:55.470
mazza

0:12:55.470,0:12:59.770
data so tremendously accessatlanta
dictionary

0:12:59.770,0:13:02.040
you can say type meta

0:13:02.040,0:13:03.720
it'd node

0:13:03.720,0:13:08.150
and then we can also take remember who's
is a great command and i thought

0:13:08.150,0:13:11.930
so we can see what we've got caught up
in here terminated node

0:13:11.930,0:13:13.539
pose a little bit more about it

0:13:13.539,0:13:15.840
so let's see if we can grab out

0:13:15.840,0:13:17.760
that directly from the top

0:13:17.760,0:13:20.630
so we could have also done

0:13:20.630,0:13:22.370
flash

0:13:22.370,0:13:24.640
bag

0:13:24.640,0:13:26.390
risk or roots slash

0:13:26.390,0:13:29.270
so this is the equivalent so predictable

0:13:29.270,0:13:31.700
it looks exactly the same

0:13:31.700,0:13:36.130
so it's nice to be able to up axis india
relatives were absolutely in the past

0:13:36.130,0:13:37.840
now let's go

0:13:37.840,0:13:44.690
grab the tax out of the matter data so
we can say member data equals

0:13:44.690,0:13:47.360
and then we can say

0:13:47.360,0:13:50.480
single quote join them on since the
second

0:13:50.480,0:13:53.580
mitigated node dot value

0:13:53.580,0:13:56.790
that's what we're gonna run the second
poster dot piece-by-piece open up our

0:13:56.790,0:13:59.440
own in front of it the common enough for
now

0:13:59.440,0:14:02.300
in just a minute data

0:14:02.300,0:14:04.590
node

0:14:04.590,0:14:05.800
top value

0:14:05.800,0:14:06.990
presenter

0:14:06.990,0:14:09.589
and you'll see that we now have an array
in there

0:14:09.589,0:14:11.220
uh... type

0:14:11.220,0:14:12.520
uh... s one

0:14:12.520,0:14:16.410
so a string of white wine and we see the
bits and pieces so we can use to

0:14:16.410,0:14:18.140
strengthen the enjoying

0:14:18.140,0:14:19.780
which takes separator

0:14:19.780,0:14:20.959
and analyst

0:14:20.959,0:14:24.720
as an argument emphasis together with
the separated between each one

0:14:24.720,0:14:28.600
if we use it empty separator says that
that's right here with the three single

0:14:28.600,0:14:29.690
quotes

0:14:29.690,0:14:33.540
that means it'll take all text insecure
if they can see each other

0:14:33.540,0:14:38.860
so go back up their control made the
front control d to delete that pound

0:14:38.860,0:14:40.029
and hit enter

0:14:40.029,0:14:45.640
and now it's too who's in see we've got
in terms of are no data

0:14:45.640,0:14:51.040
so we can see armidale now is a string
and it looks not too bad

0:14:51.040,0:14:53.640
if you can read x_ amount

0:14:53.640,0:14:57.080
and would also then into a string slice
of meditative

0:14:57.080,0:14:57.860
and then

0:14:57.860,0:15:02.240
will take the first fifteen so uh...
point here means

0:15:02.240,0:15:04.440
starved beginning colin and then do

0:15:04.440,0:15:07.420
move through the fiftieth character

0:15:07.420,0:15:09.320
so there's the first fifty

0:15:09.320,0:15:12.700
characters in armidale

0:15:12.700,0:15:13.380
right so

0:15:13.380,0:15:15.680
we're gonna leave that for another

0:15:15.680,0:15:20.070
video text you go into what is exim alan
how to work with its in such a topic you

0:15:20.070,0:15:22.840
know itself and we're going to move on

0:15:22.840,0:15:24.360
to the

0:15:24.360,0:15:28.810
array grades terror activity in the file
the uh...

0:15:28.810,0:15:31.720
bathymetry or in this case is called
elevation

0:15:31.720,0:15:34.550
so for that were any some more modules
we're gonna need

0:15:34.550,0:15:37.660
to get the number while i bring
something to hide

0:15:37.660,0:15:39.249
imports number higher

0:15:39.249,0:15:40.960
and that were used

0:15:40.960,0:15:45.220
with the is finite into the not the
number

0:15:45.220,0:15:46.920
uh... items

0:15:46.920,0:15:49.020
you'll see the plot so from

0:15:49.020,0:15:51.080
map plot lube

0:15:51.080,0:15:52.400
import

0:15:52.400,0:15:54.070
pipe lots

0:15:54.070,0:15:58.529
memorize skipped using the debtor
high-level option with

0:15:58.529,0:16:01.469
typewriter and to make sure it's
explicitly clear where i'm getting stuff

0:16:01.469,0:16:02.690
from

0:16:02.690,0:16:07.500
in were also commits a pipeline dot
interactive and set that's true and what

0:16:07.500,0:16:10.520
this does is every time we do some
planning is going to always look at the

0:16:10.520,0:16:12.060
figure right away

0:16:12.060,0:16:17.200
so i think it's too hard to see what's
going on and we have some troubles

0:16:17.200,0:16:18.980
so now we can say

0:16:18.980,0:16:23.930
uh... let's go grab our elevation so
that's in our bag with a bag dot

0:16:23.930,0:16:28.230
first our roots dot items

0:16:28.230,0:16:32.310
and we have our elevations who want to
grab that out

0:16:32.310,0:16:34.990
him to say

0:16:34.990,0:16:37.200
roots

0:16:37.200,0:16:41.050
elevations

0:16:41.050,0:16:42.070
now

0:16:42.070,0:16:48.590
we can set that elevation nodes to be
equal to that

0:16:48.590,0:16:49.699
and

0:16:49.699,0:16:52.750
there's no passing politicians

0:16:52.750,0:16:57.870
so maimed in exist i hadn't extra
cascading parade in here

0:16:57.870,0:17:00.360
okay so that we can say type

0:17:00.360,0:17:02.510
television node

0:17:02.510,0:17:03.120
you who

0:17:03.120,0:17:06.039
lose and see that we now have

0:17:06.039,0:17:07.669
harkins right here

0:17:07.669,0:17:11.299
now we actually don't want to do this
every one of the array value

0:17:11.299,0:17:15.199
the bc matrix or current of elevations

0:17:15.199,0:17:18.390
students say elevation equals

0:17:18.390,0:17:21.549
elevation nodes dot value

0:17:21.549,0:17:22.779
whose again

0:17:22.779,0:17:25.870
and now will see that we've actually
cutter elevations

0:17:25.870,0:17:28.550
and and the rate now thoughts
overwhelming

0:17:28.550,0:17:31.280
whose lets you search by tight school
type

0:17:31.280,0:17:33.740
new space and the parade

0:17:33.740,0:17:37.070
answered more me get back to the and the
a race

0:17:37.070,0:17:39.320
so use this fairly often to you

0:17:39.320,0:17:42.150
constrain are searches of local
variables in our

0:17:42.150,0:17:43.870
namespace we've got for

0:17:43.870,0:17:47.420
i typed on interactive session

0:17:47.420,0:17:51.780
now let's take a look at our elevations
with the elevation dot shape

0:17:51.780,0:17:53.299
as for the return us

0:17:53.299,0:17:59.030
in here that with my height is the same
as we see right appear in the summer

0:17:59.030,0:18:02.179
and you can see that we're using eleven
megabytes of data

0:18:02.179,0:18:03.080
the total

0:18:03.080,0:18:04.909
humber breaks is right there

0:18:04.909,0:18:09.510
turner megabytes invites are a little
bit difference with the power fusions

0:18:09.510,0:18:11.910
there thirty two bit floating-point
parade

0:18:11.910,0:18:15.880
with this many elements

0:18:15.880,0:18:17.530
so now let's take a little bit

0:18:17.530,0:18:21.230
about look into it necessary elevation
dot men

0:18:21.230,0:18:23.409
at the minimum value out of it

0:18:23.409,0:18:25.880
and we can do the maximum

0:18:25.880,0:18:29.049
and now this is an meters this since we
have a

0:18:29.049,0:18:31.130
bag of asymmetry here

0:18:31.130,0:18:32.880
entered

0:18:32.880,0:18:37.500
this numbers a little surprising and if
you think about uh... elevations

0:18:37.500,0:18:40.580
positive is up negative is down so when
you're on this

0:18:40.580,0:18:42.450
underneath the ocean

0:18:42.450,0:18:47.000
you should be seen negative numbers
typically depending on your gurgaon

0:18:47.000,0:18:49.470
and in here

0:18:49.470,0:18:52.880
very large number or is actually one key

0:18:52.880,0:18:57.130
one point road he six in full
implementation

0:18:57.130,0:19:01.790
so that's one million that one million
is actually a marker for cells that have

0:19:01.790,0:19:02.870
no data

0:19:02.870,0:19:06.630
and we need to remove those from the
plot

0:19:06.630,0:19:09.450
it's not very helpful to have the in
their if

0:19:09.450,0:19:13.870
we are going to u decency sex on that
with a minimum the maximum things like

0:19:13.870,0:19:14.610
that

0:19:14.610,0:19:16.580
but we can try really quick

0:19:16.580,0:19:18.559
so if we say

0:19:18.559,0:19:19.830
uh...

0:19:19.830,0:19:22.140
we could rent a elevations

0:19:22.140,0:19:24.289
uh... and get the

0:19:24.289,0:19:27.280
means their deviation but right now
they're going to be pretty much done so

0:19:27.280,0:19:29.810
please stay coalition

0:19:29.810,0:19:32.370
mean

0:19:32.370,0:19:37.419
uh... uses the number doesn't really
make a lot of sense

0:19:37.419,0:19:42.720
all right so let's go ahead and comfort
that into properly shaped

0:19:42.720,0:19:44.610
uh... item

0:19:44.610,0:19:45.840
solis

0:19:45.840,0:19:50.600
approval for it to you that we actually
went turn those things into in the end

0:19:50.600,0:19:54.200
that the new data values and we want to
make those me and so that we can imply

0:19:54.200,0:19:59.460
an emotional correctly if that's what it
now system look like junk

0:19:59.460,0:20:02.610
so what we need to do it is berkeley
circle of asian

0:20:02.610,0:20:06.110
with uh...

0:20:06.110,0:20:08.530
a hat

0:20:08.530,0:20:13.000
no number so we can say elevation

0:20:13.000,0:20:17.920
and this is a fun funny mode that number
has our elevations can actually be

0:20:17.920,0:20:20.120
sat can we create sort of

0:20:20.120,0:20:23.000
taken boolean masks as a true false

0:20:23.000,0:20:26.159
mask of what's in

0:20:26.159,0:20:29.330
near a so anything with that large value

0:20:29.330,0:20:32.700
we wanna said to me and and to me
because they make a little matrix that

0:20:32.700,0:20:36.590
goes with it that's true or false or
whether we want to say it's in the end

0:20:36.590,0:20:38.360
so we can say elevation

0:20:38.360,0:20:41.789
is greater than the ticket number that's
a little bit lower than our

0:20:41.789,0:20:42.510
uh...

0:20:42.510,0:20:45.740
no data value so we could say like nine

0:20:45.740,0:20:46.960
nine

0:20:46.960,0:20:49.730
for nine point

0:20:49.730,0:20:51.580
e

0:20:51.580,0:20:54.620
animal save five

0:20:54.620,0:20:57.510
uh... equals num hive

0:20:57.510,0:20:59.230
and annie

0:20:59.230,0:21:02.650
and which is not a number answer

0:21:02.650,0:21:04.789
this is so um...

0:21:04.789,0:21:09.179
they very fancy way in number heights
you do setting of all values

0:21:09.179,0:21:12.880
inside of are

0:21:12.880,0:21:14.940
so that we can say

0:21:14.940,0:21:17.210
pie

0:21:17.210,0:21:19.130
plots

0:21:19.130,0:21:22.510
figure one serve offer figure one

0:21:22.510,0:21:23.799
and with this

0:21:23.799,0:21:25.670
we're going to want to

0:21:25.670,0:21:29.600
actually have to figures for ramona part
of the family tree and then the

0:21:29.600,0:21:31.980
histogram of the values in there

0:21:31.980,0:21:36.390
so we're gonna set up subplots still say
pi clot

0:21:36.390,0:21:39.070
dot so

0:21:39.070,0:21:41.640
ending here i'm gonna want to say

0:21:41.640,0:21:44.020
one sore and i have

0:21:44.020,0:21:44.789
in the

0:21:44.789,0:21:48.960
vertical direction one robe and we want
to columns

0:21:48.960,0:21:51.900
camera start at number one

0:21:51.900,0:21:55.850
soviet enter a member cannot publish
starts counting pat one rather than the

0:21:55.850,0:21:58.080
normal icon zero to match malad

0:21:58.080,0:21:59.540
standard

0:21:59.540,0:22:02.970
if we look at our figure we now have a
blank figure in here

0:22:02.970,0:22:06.690
with reshape it so it's a little more
square just for koreans doesn't really

0:22:06.690,0:22:08.150
matter

0:22:08.150,0:22:10.030
and they worked out our figure going

0:22:10.030,0:22:11.590
so what's now say

0:22:11.590,0:22:12.809
um...

0:22:12.809,0:22:16.770
plotting it and sends it to be a rate we
can just use plot we have to use it like

0:22:16.770,0:22:20.970
more like an image since a pipe

0:22:20.970,0:22:23.080
i am show

0:22:23.080,0:22:27.890
and in our data statistic politician hit
pitcher

0:22:27.890,0:22:29.480
and

0:22:29.480,0:22:30.450
hopefully very soon

0:22:30.450,0:22:32.260
and we will have

0:22:32.260,0:22:33.620
out there we go

0:22:33.620,0:22:38.420
we now have our the symmetry in here
which isn't liked typical morphine

0:22:38.420,0:22:41.930
definate remember that this is vertical
being or single bean

0:22:41.930,0:22:43.850
they did so underneath the ship

0:22:43.850,0:22:46.349
there should be just a line of points

0:22:46.349,0:22:49.760
as the ship drives along collecting data

0:22:49.760,0:22:53.919
not as pretty as multimedia they can be
very effective for building

0:22:53.919,0:22:55.940
different regrets

0:22:55.940,0:23:02.230
p then we need to teach interpolation if
you want and i through surface levels

0:23:02.230,0:23:05.070
right so to take a look at the state of
values

0:23:05.070,0:23:09.150
we'd like to get a histogram of all of
the value ranges that we have american a

0:23:09.150,0:23:11.669
right now if we save

0:23:11.669,0:23:14.049
elevation dot min

0:23:14.049,0:23:14.960
we get back to la

0:23:14.960,0:23:20.200
number and max beget na number these are
really very helpful salutes

0:23:20.200,0:23:21.140
changed that

0:23:21.140,0:23:25.650
original ray make a new array that's a
one-dimensional rate with out demand so

0:23:25.650,0:23:28.710
that we can handle the histogram off of
that

0:23:28.710,0:23:32.380
so the first thing will do his will make
a one-dimensional arraigned and we can

0:23:32.380,0:23:35.000
do that by reshaping our elevation

0:23:35.000,0:23:37.980
it weakens the elevation dot reshape

0:23:37.980,0:23:39.630
and then we can pass in

0:23:39.630,0:23:42.940
besides who want to have it be in the
first dimension

0:23:42.940,0:23:46.429
and what will to tears will make it the
total length of all the number of cells

0:23:46.429,0:23:51.220
in the car to your race elevation
ont-size

0:23:51.220,0:23:52.380
press center

0:23:52.380,0:23:53.360
and type of who

0:23:53.360,0:23:54.640
music andy

0:23:54.640,0:23:56.620
correct first take a peek

0:23:56.620,0:23:58.590
so here we have our original data

0:23:58.590,0:24:00.919
which is a t but you grin

0:24:00.919,0:24:03.419
rachie dimensional green her writing

0:24:03.419,0:24:05.299
or before called matrix

0:24:05.299,0:24:08.510
and here we have our one d one which
only has

0:24:08.510,0:24:10.899
one dimension that with a lot more cells

0:24:10.899,0:24:14.940
but if you know as we have the same
number of elements involved

0:24:14.940,0:24:16.550
so that's gotten us going

0:24:16.550,0:24:19.310
but we still have those names in there
that we'd like to get rid of so we can

0:24:19.310,0:24:25.260
say elevation when the underscore finite
meaning that they actually has values

0:24:25.260,0:24:29.970
groups equals and then empty list sold
to his will look through all of the

0:24:29.970,0:24:35.450
values in the elevation wendy ammo only
put the ones that have an actual number

0:24:35.450,0:24:36.950
values not

0:24:36.950,0:24:38.210
union

0:24:38.210,0:24:39.450
that'll be that

0:24:39.450,0:24:41.039
that our actual numbers

0:24:41.039,0:24:43.680
into this elevation would be fine

0:24:43.680,0:24:45.320
so it's

0:24:45.320,0:24:48.320
and i will say four item in

0:24:48.320,0:24:52.830
elevation won the

0:24:52.830,0:24:54.840
and then colin

0:24:54.840,0:24:58.870
and what this will do is then loop
through all of the elements and return

0:24:58.870,0:25:01.820
them has

0:25:01.820,0:25:02.840
hit enter

0:25:02.840,0:25:05.410
agreement can say gift

0:25:05.410,0:25:07.779
number hyatt

0:25:07.779,0:25:13.550
finite

0:25:13.550,0:25:16.830
and then decided that will then put

0:25:16.830,0:25:19.680
dumps sorry that will be his friends

0:25:19.680,0:25:23.160
and in their will put their item so fast

0:25:23.160,0:25:26.900
true we actually have a number then
we'll say elevation

0:25:26.900,0:25:28.409
wendy

0:25:28.409,0:25:30.810
and then finite

0:25:30.810,0:25:36.590
for that variable will depend on our new
value so and item

0:25:36.590,0:25:37.990
wellhead answer

0:25:37.990,0:25:41.200
and this is kind of a slow operation
because working with st louis is

0:25:41.200,0:25:44.070
creating a lot of little python objects

0:25:44.070,0:25:48.440
num prize claim to fame is that does
most of the things on the seaside

0:25:48.440,0:25:52.309
sitaram so the compiled
behind-the-scenes tight on

0:25:52.309,0:25:53.880
not in the interpreter

0:25:53.880,0:25:55.320
so goes really fast

0:25:55.320,0:25:58.240
some portions one goes kinda slope

0:25:58.240,0:25:59.750
in if we

0:25:59.750,0:26:05.010
then want to use this in a fast moving
he did say profusely who's into peacock

0:26:05.010,0:26:07.480
so right now we can say

0:26:07.480,0:26:12.260
we look here we should see elevation
wendy finite and notice it's type is a

0:26:12.260,0:26:13.820
list

0:26:13.820,0:26:18.100
and that's going to get more every
single preschool

0:26:18.100,0:26:21.350
so what we can say is

0:26:21.350,0:26:27.500
elevation wendy finite equals number
tied up arranged for the school just

0:26:27.500,0:26:31.250
converted into a rain pretty quickly if
you can

0:26:31.250,0:26:33.880
an elevation wendy

0:26:33.880,0:26:35.480
finite

0:26:35.480,0:26:37.010
took a hit enter

0:26:37.010,0:26:42.610
it's converted back into analyze parade
through tech whose and andy array you

0:26:42.610,0:26:44.420
get rid of all that noise

0:26:44.420,0:26:48.400
and now are alicia mundy finite is

0:26:48.400,0:26:52.550
and andy arranged and it looks like it's
a typo thirty-two just like it but

0:26:52.550,0:26:56.090
notice we've gone from eleven megabytes
two one megabyte so it's gotten a lot

0:26:56.090,0:26:57.149
smaller

0:26:57.149,0:27:01.720
let's see how much of that data is full
of names or empty data cells in the

0:27:01.720,0:27:02.299
script

0:27:02.299,0:27:07.159
so we can say it would create person and
so one hundred times

0:27:07.159,0:27:11.260
an hour and divide by

0:27:11.260,0:27:12.759
length of

0:27:12.759,0:27:13.940
elevation

0:27:13.940,0:27:18.789
one d so this is the total number of
cells we started with and now we need

0:27:18.789,0:27:21.900
the number of cells that aren't me and
says we can say

0:27:21.900,0:27:23.329
length of

0:27:23.329,0:27:24.620
elevation

0:27:24.620,0:27:25.779
onesie

0:27:25.779,0:27:28.990
minus the ones that actually had davis
with the commission

0:27:28.990,0:27:31.400
or length of elevation

0:27:31.400,0:27:32.799
onesie

0:27:32.799,0:27:34.580
finite

0:27:34.580,0:27:36.400
so that's that she didn't give us

0:27:36.400,0:27:39.789
this number minutes this number

0:27:39.789,0:27:40.750
became

0:27:40.750,0:27:42.640
uh... we also p careful here

0:27:42.640,0:27:47.460
brandy division by two different numbers
an impact on two point whichever version

0:27:47.460,0:27:49.530
as long as you know i mean python three

0:27:49.530,0:27:54.399
division of two injures is not are going
to round interview injured so

0:27:54.399,0:27:57.279
in this case for eric and i have a
number of clean zero in one

0:27:57.279,0:28:00.630
we need to make at least one of the few
things that were dividing reidy afloat

0:28:00.630,0:28:05.990
which would cause the hoping to become a
folks we can say float here

0:28:05.990,0:28:07.880
hopefully for all that

0:28:07.880,0:28:12.520
and i'm gonna go ahead and pressed enter
we should see a percentage so here it

0:28:12.520,0:28:13.990
looks like

0:28:13.990,0:28:19.630
ninety point four percent of the data in
this grade is no data so it's mostly

0:28:19.630,0:28:22.760
empty space there's not a lot of
information in there it's only ten

0:28:22.760,0:28:26.070
percent full of actual with richard gere

0:28:26.070,0:28:27.919
let's go ahead and

0:28:27.919,0:28:30.919
changer subplot and see if we can make a
histogram with this

0:28:30.919,0:28:33.560
source a pie wat

0:28:33.560,0:28:38.650
subplots cameras they want to use so
that was a rose and homes around move on

0:28:38.650,0:28:40.560
to the too

0:28:40.560,0:28:41.350
section

0:28:41.350,0:28:44.610
food should basically put a

0:28:44.610,0:28:46.190
item right here

0:28:46.190,0:28:48.350
ball hit

0:28:48.350,0:28:51.500
and now we have a blank warna mera

0:28:51.500,0:28:52.910
analyst go ahead

0:28:52.910,0:28:53.770
hands

0:28:53.770,0:28:57.820
see if we can do in the streets of
pipeline thought his

0:28:57.820,0:29:02.519
will then pass it are elevation won the
finite

0:29:02.519,0:29:04.990
and from that we can then

0:29:04.990,0:29:09.549
uh... saved bins equals fifty their
member of the number of bins in history

0:29:09.549,0:29:13.130
and can be very important change quite
radically

0:29:13.130,0:29:16.230
how the ellipse

0:29:16.230,0:29:19.560
it tells us all the big day there with
him actually look at that moment over

0:29:19.560,0:29:21.290
here is c_n_n_'s histogram

0:29:21.290,0:29:23.480
and was tried couple different

0:29:23.480,0:29:27.440
been sizes so will try one hundred dense

0:29:27.440,0:29:30.370
and two hundred bins

0:29:30.370,0:29:33.500
and now will go back to take a peek at
are

0:29:33.500,0:29:35.200
three different histograms

0:29:35.200,0:29:38.450
with different it's the same day that
the different banning

0:29:38.450,0:29:41.870
animal seeing here

0:29:41.870,0:29:43.350
that we've got

0:29:43.350,0:29:44.350
are

0:29:44.350,0:29:47.120
fifty are hundred under two hundred

0:29:47.120,0:29:50.049
so we can see that it is running between
minus seventeen

0:29:50.049,0:29:50.950
and

0:29:50.950,0:29:56.830
nine meters with an average somewhere in
the middle around minus fourteen or so

0:29:56.830,0:29:59.270
and now we have a one zero eight without

0:29:59.270,0:30:02.710
and indians in that we can actually
start asking subsistence questions so we

0:30:02.710,0:30:04.290
can say

0:30:04.290,0:30:08.830
elevation one d finance dot min that
should be

0:30:08.830,0:30:12.020
the same value ours minus fifteen point
nine nine

0:30:12.020,0:30:14.020
amicus imax

0:30:14.020,0:30:16.970
and we actually get a much more
reasonable value now we get minus eight

0:30:16.970,0:30:18.860
point eighty eight meters

0:30:18.860,0:30:22.560
which also asked some other interesting
things with victims have what does that

0:30:22.560,0:30:23.280
mean

0:30:23.280,0:30:25.540
value of all this data

0:30:25.540,0:30:29.169
it's minus thirteen point pete peters

0:30:29.169,0:30:32.490
and so there isn't terribly important
here but we can ask for standard

0:30:32.490,0:30:35.240
deviation of the data

0:30:35.240,0:30:40.520
and we see that that's one point three
meters away from minus one

0:30:40.520,0:30:45.029
one three or thirteen leaders

0:30:45.029,0:30:47.039
ended with this

0:30:47.039,0:30:49.960
we now have our view of our date in our
become intrigued

0:30:49.960,0:30:53.450
and she give you a sense of working with
hdfc five files and pulling out the

0:30:53.450,0:30:55.429
different layers in python

0:30:55.429,0:30:57.820
much more flexible them with the command
line

0:30:57.820,0:31:02.700
issue five library with each five ls age
for example

0:31:02.700,0:31:06.980
thanks for watching and that future
videos will cover looking into the x_

0:31:06.980,0:31:09.350
amount of data

0:31:09.350,0:31:10.480
doing a little bit more with that
