Hi.  My name is Kurt Schwehr and welcome to 
video 2 for research tools at the

0:00:07.300,0:00:11.299
University New Hampshire, Center for Coastal
and Ocean Mapping.

0:00:11.299,0:00:13.320
In this video, I'm going to show you

0:00:13.320,0:00:14.239
more advanced

0:00:14.239,0:00:17.519
techniques of using GNU Emacs

0:00:17.519,0:00:22.339
to do a lot more than we did last
time when we just did keyboard motion.

0:00:22.339,0:00:24.349
Today, we're going to look at

0:00:24.349,0:00:29.019
dired mode looking at directories.
We're going to open up the shell inside of emacs

0:00:29.019,0:00:30.270
And we are going to do

0:00:30.270,0:00:31.609
more advanced

0:00:31.609,0:00:34.780
manipulation of text inside of emacs.

0:00:34.780,0:00:36.149
Let's start off by

0:00:36.149,0:00:40.060
looking into the directory edit
mode or "dired" mode.

0:00:40.060,0:00:42.260
In this mode, if we are open up a file:

0:00:42.260,0:00:44.890
Control x Control f

0:00:44.890,0:00:46.520
and for that file,

0:00:46.520,0:00:49.650
we're just gonna open up the current
directory.  So if you look at the bottom

0:00:49.650,0:00:53.789
here, it says find file colon and then it syas
tilde slash, which is our

0:00:53.789,0:00:56.490
home directory in Linux.  If I 

0:00:56.490,0:01:00.790
press enter there, we've entered into what's
called dired mode.

0:01:00.790,0:01:03.390
And in directory edit mode we can
actually

0:01:03.390,0:01:05.979
operate on files and directories.

0:01:05.979,0:01:08.790
There's a whole bunch of new menus up
at the top.

0:01:08.790,0:01:13.790
We have operate. We can copy, rename,
delete. etcetera etcetera.

0:01:13.790,0:01:20.310
We can mark things for actions.  We can go
through and flag for deletion.

0:01:20.310,0:01:22.470
so let's go ahead and do that real
quick.

0:01:22.470,0:01:27.360
I have a backup file.  Emacs writes tilde
files that are back ups of old things.

0:01:27.360,0:01:30.280
So you can flag something with a "d" key.

0:01:30.280,0:01:32.700
And it will mark it for deletion.

0:01:32.700,0:01:37.070
And, for example, I can go down here and to another
one to mark that one.

0:01:37.070,0:01:40.490
There's my dot emacs tilde back up.

0:01:40.490,0:01:44.160
And then you can press x to execute.

0:01:44.160,0:01:45.790
So, under mark.

0:01:45.790,0:01:47.440
We've done done the "d".

0:01:47.440,0:01:51.930
And operate should have an x somewhere in
here. I don't see it, but we will just go ahead and do

0:01:51.930,0:01:53.430
it. We'll press the latter

0:01:53.430,0:01:54.550
x

0:01:54.550,0:01:55.950
for execute.

0:01:55.950,0:02:00.550
It says, "Do we want to delete it these
two files?" We can type "yes" or "no."

0:02:00.550,0:02:02.350
"yes." Get rid of them.

0:02:02.350,0:02:05.659
And they are now gone for good.

0:02:05.659,0:02:06.750
Another

0:02:06.750,0:02:09.560
really nicely command under

0:02:09.560,0:02:12.040
immediate. The plus key (+)

0:02:12.040,0:02:13.899
will actually do a

0:02:13.899,0:02:18.139
directory creation. So  let's create ourselves a
directory for this

0:02:18.139,0:02:19.290
tutorial.

0:02:19.290,0:02:21.519
We'll press the plus key.

0:02:21.519,0:02:23.119
Create directory.

0:02:23.119,0:02:27.979
And we'll write tutorial-2.

0:02:27.979,0:02:33.589
And so now you're looking at right here
in the middle: tutorial-2.

0:02:33.589,0:02:37.469
On any of these entries, you can press the
enter key

0:02:37.469,0:02:41.229
and it will take you either into the
file or into the directory.

0:02:41.229,0:02:43.269
So I pressed enter on tutorial-2

0:02:43.269,0:02:46.489
and now we are in an empty directory.

0:02:46.489,0:02:49.079
Let's go ahead and open up

0:02:49.079,0:02:53.400
a file to write in: tutorial dot

0:02:53.400,0:02:55.689
t x t

0:02:55.689,0:02:57.720
So now we are inside a file in there.

0:02:57.720,0:03:02.889
And if you remember from before we, can split
our display in two with control x 2

0:03:02.889,0:03:06.959
So, see that in the bottom left over here is
a control x and then the

0:03:06.959,0:03:09.269
number 2.

0:03:09.269,0:03:13.409
And then we can do that control x b
to switch buffers.

0:03:13.409,0:03:17.319
And we'll switch back to the tutorial-2 by
pressing enter.

0:03:17.319,0:03:18.049
So,

0:03:18.049,0:03:19.649
control x

0:03:19.649,0:03:22.499
2

0:03:22.499,0:03:23.409
split

0:03:23.409,0:03:28.639
and control x b

0:03:28.639,0:03:32.919
switch to a

0:03:32.919,0:03:35.450
different buffer

0:03:35.450,0:03:38.559
inside of one window

0:03:38.559,0:03:40.019
and control

0:03:40.019,0:03:45.149
x o, which I've just been using without telling you, is

0:03:45.149,0:03:48.439
jump to other buffer.

0:03:48.439,0:03:51.149
Okay, great.

0:03:51.149,0:03:54.779
So now let's go look at this directory.
We can keep it around.

0:03:54.779,0:03:57.139
And i'm going to split this again in 2.
to know

0:03:57.139,0:04:00.459
So now we have lots of little windows.
You can drag them around and give outselves a

0:04:00.459,0:04:02.879
little more space with the mouse.

0:04:02.879,0:04:05.249
Today I'm going to go ahead and use the
mouse.

0:04:05.249,0:04:08.339
And in this top one, let's go ahead and
open up a terminal.

0:04:08.339,0:04:11.879
We can then do it inside of emacs and keep
everything the same between all of our

0:04:11.879,0:04:12.969
systems.

0:04:12.969,0:04:18.509
So we don't have to jump back and forth
between external terminal and emacs.

0:04:18.509,0:04:21.320
So I'm going to type meta x or the escape key.

0:04:21.320,0:04:25.940
And then the letter x.  I'm letting go of all keys
and then I'm going to type the word "shell" s h


0:04:25.940,0:04:28.030
e l l

0:04:28.030,0:04:29.630
Press enter.

0:04:29.630,0:04:31.330
And I'm now looking a 

0:04:31.330,0:04:33.669
shell.

0:04:33.669,0:04:35.930
I'll add that down here.

0:04:35.930,0:04:39.960
Meta x shell

0:04:39.960,0:04:41.600
start a

0:04:41.600,0:04:43.300
bash command

0:04:43.300,0:04:45.489
line.  Great.

0:04:45.489,0:04:47.309
So inside that shell

0:04:47.309,0:04:50.490
we can do normal things of "ls".
There's not much in yet.

0:04:50.490,0:04:52.330
ls -la

0:04:52.330,0:04:55.689
And here again, you'll see that tilde
file that's created.

0:04:55.689,0:05:00.659
The regular tutorial dot t x t
is the file that I'm editing down below.

0:05:00.659,0:05:06.339
and the tutorial dot t x t is a file
that I am currently working on.

0:05:06.339,0:05:07.620
and the backup.

0:05:07.620,0:05:10.580
Now if we go to the tutorial-2,

0:05:10.580,0:05:14.899
in here, nothing has changed even though 
we know we've created a tutorial

0:05:14.899,0:05:18.789
file and there is a backup for it. But there's
nothing here.  What can we do?

0:05:18.789,0:05:21.999
There is actually the "g" key. If you press
that,

0:05:21.999,0:05:23.820
will update the directory.

0:05:23.820,0:05:24.709
And then,

0:05:24.709,0:05:27.789
you'll have everything set up so that

0:05:27.789,0:05:31.900
it's currently updated.

0:05:31.900,0:05:35.930
And again, we're now in dired mode and up
above

0:05:35.930,0:05:37.230
we have the shell.

0:05:37.230,0:05:40.949
And do a "pwd".  You can do all the normal
things.

0:05:40.949,0:05:41.770
Now if you are

0:05:41.770,0:05:44.160
if you're trying to work on something
and it's 

0:05:44.160,0:05:46.539
giving you trouble.

0:05:46.539,0:05:49.960
Let's see if I can cause some trouble here.

0:05:49.960,0:05:54.619
Now we're in. I've typed less tutorial dot t x t.
And this is not a normal terminal.

0:05:54.619,0:05:57.999
less doesn't know how to jump up and
down pages

0:05:57.999,0:06:00.889
because it is actually a text editing buffer
So it's confused

0:06:00.889,0:06:02.380
and stuck here.  We could

0:06:02.380,0:06:04.479
press return and it would all be fine.

0:06:04.479,0:06:08.050
But let me show you the signals: how to
break out of a tool that's being

0:06:08.050,0:06:09.809
grumpy.

0:06:09.809,0:06:14.110
Under signals, we have control c control
c, which is break.  And I will try to

0:06:14.110,0:06:19.009
break out of it with the normal control c.
So, let's try that.

0:06:19.009,0:06:20.979
And that seemed to go okay.

0:06:20.979,0:06:24.759
But we can also.  If that doesn't work you,
can go down and you can press

0:06:24.759,0:06:26.580
the killed one.

0:06:26.580,0:06:31.389
And that really forces it to quit out
completely.

0:06:31.389,0:06:35.319
So if ever you need to get out of tools,
don't forget about that

0:06:35.319,0:06:37.009
tool right there.

0:06:37.009,0:06:40.999
And let's go back to out tutorials.

0:06:40.999,0:06:45.940
I'll hide everything by typing control x
1.

0:06:45.940,0:06:50.690
And let's look at some functionality
inside of a buffer and what we can do

0:06:50.690,0:06:53.599
with are finding things.

0:06:53.599,0:06:57.430
And. So last time we had control s,
which was search

0:06:57.430,0:07:00.000
and control g to quit out of that.

0:07:00.000,0:07:03.419
Now if we want to replace text, we can
do meta x

0:07:03.419,0:07:04.759
query

0:07:04.759,0:07:08.080
replace

0:07:08.080,0:07:11.560
"hello" with "world" by pressing enter for
each one.

0:07:11.560,0:07:14.759
This is a nonsensical things doesn't
exist just to show you.

0:07:14.759,0:07:17.440
And nothing happened because they were
not.

0:07:17.440,0:07:20.479
But you can also have done

0:07:20.479,0:07:21.809
meta

0:07:21.809,0:07:24.249
percent, which is

0:07:24.249,0:07:25.690
equivalent

0:07:25.690,0:07:27.389
a k a

0:07:27.389,0:07:30.289
meta x query

0:07:30.289,0:07:32.309
replace.

0:07:32.309,0:07:36.889
Then, if we want to replace all of them without
any asking us, because if there's a huge

0:07:36.889,0:07:40.979
document you may want to be replacing
hundreds of instances,

0:07:40.979,0:07:42.770
what we can do is

0:07:42.770,0:07:46.539
meta x replace string rather than query.

0:07:46.539,0:07:49.369
So we can

0:07:49.369,0:07:53.660
doing meta x replace string.

0:07:53.660,0:07:56.110
And now if you notice that, I'm going to 
control g

0:07:56.110,0:07:57.380
We'll do meta x

0:07:57.380,0:07:58.909
replace

0:07:58.909,0:08:03.189
I hit tab after typing r e p. It completed out

0:08:03.189,0:08:07.060
not very much, but if I did and l,
type out replace.

0:08:07.060,0:08:08.849
I've hit tab.

0:08:08.849,0:08:10.969
Not if I just hit s t r,

0:08:10.969,0:08:11.939
if I complete it,

0:08:11.939,0:08:15.030
with the tab key, we'll get the full
string.  But if I back that up and just

0:08:15.030,0:08:19.479
give a unique string that's good enough and I
know that s t r is enough, press enter

0:08:19.479,0:08:20.569
here,

0:08:20.569,0:08:22.009
it figured out thats

0:08:22.009,0:08:23.589
replace string.

0:08:23.589,0:08:26.190
So let's replace the word string

0:08:26.190,0:08:29.580
with capital String.

0:08:29.580,0:08:31.349
And so now, if you look at here,

0:08:31.349,0:08:33.210
we have

0:08:33.210,0:08:34.610
capital String.

0:08:34.610,0:08:36.880
Which brings me to my next set of
commands

0:08:36.880,0:08:39.970
that I would like to show you.

0:08:39.970,0:08:42.070
And that's how to

0:08:42.070,0:08:45.410
change the capitalization of
letters.

0:08:45.410,0:08:47.230
So, we have

0:08:47.230,0:08:49.140
meta u,

0:08:49.140,0:08:51.740
which is uppercase.  So meta u

0:08:51.740,0:08:56.750
makes that upper case.

0:08:56.750,0:08:59.680
Uppercase for the next word.

0:08:59.680,0:09:01.700
If we do meta l,

0:09:01.700,0:09:07.840
that's lower case.

0:09:07.840,0:09:10.120
So if I do meta l,

0:09:10.120,0:09:14.240
it's lower case.  Meta l, lower case.

0:09:14.240,0:09:16.920
And a third one is meta c:

0:09:16.920,0:09:21.390
capitalize.

0:09:21.390,0:09:24.430
now i can check the spelling on
capitalizes.

0:09:24.430,0:09:26.330
And if I type escape 

0:09:26.330,0:09:27.690
dollar sign,

0:09:27.690,0:09:31.020
that will let me spell check and then I'll
look up

0:09:31.020,0:09:35.960
and then I realize that I want capitalize.  It is
number one and I will press 1.

0:09:35.960,0:09:36.699
So now we've 

0:09:36.699,0:09:39.520
capitalize.  So let's go try capitalize

0:09:39.520,0:09:40.740
and we'll do

0:09:40.740,0:09:42.970
meta c.  And meta c and we've

0:09:42.970,0:09:44.710
capitalized those two.

0:09:44.710,0:09:49.360
Now really, we want lower case, so I'll do 
meta l for lower.

0:09:49.360,0:09:50.790
And our string is now

0:09:50.790,0:09:53.180
lower case.

0:09:53.180,0:09:56.670
Now, if we want to spell check more than just
one word, we can highlight a region.

0:09:56.670,0:09:59.200
So I am going to press control space

0:09:59.200,0:10:01.910
Press control space

0:10:01.910,0:10:03.640
to start

0:10:03.640,0:10:05.770
marking a region.

0:10:05.770,0:10:07.140
Control space.

0:10:07.140,0:10:09.730
I'm gonna go up a ways.

0:10:09.730,0:10:11.140
Maybe here.

0:10:11.140,0:10:14.410
I can then do a meta x

0:10:14.410,0:10:16.550
ispell

0:10:16.550,0:10:17.279
region.

0:10:17.279,0:10:21.260
And that will spell check the region here.
And so we'll walk through and checked all of it.

0:10:21.260,0:10:24.390
And there was nothing that was actually
wrong in there.

0:10:24.390,0:10:26.870
If we want to spell check an entire buffer,

0:10:26.870,0:10:31.140
we can do meta x ispell buffer,

0:10:31.140,0:10:34.110
and it's going to walk through the entire file
that you're working on.

0:10:34.110,0:10:36.560
So that was meta x

0:10:36.560,0:10:40.380
ispell region

0:10:40.380,0:10:45.430
to check a small region.

0:10:45.430,0:10:48.370
Now, this is important especially with code
where you don't want to check the whole

0:10:48.370,0:10:50.670
document because

0:10:50.670,0:10:54.740
a lot of the words that are in code
aren't necessarily in a spelling dictionary.

0:10:54.740,0:10:56.080
So ispell

0:10:56.080,0:10:57.550
buffer

0:10:57.550,0:11:02.120
will get the entire file.

0:11:02.120,0:11:05.610
Check all of the buffer.

0:11:05.610,0:11:07.100
Okay. Great. So now we've

0:11:07.100,0:11:09.700
got some pretty nice functional utilities

0:11:09.700,0:11:11.690
utilities inside of emacs

0:11:11.690,0:11:13.090
and

0:11:13.090,0:11:16.320
we want to be able to talk to other
people and in the past in my class I've

0:11:16.320,0:11:20.030
had people use ChatZilla for IRC

0:11:20.030,0:11:24.190
or the IRSSI command-line client.

0:11:24.190,0:11:26.100
But I'm show you another

0:11:26.100,0:11:29.190
tool that's different than

0:11:29.190,0:11:30.970
that

0:11:30.970,0:11:35.650
called "erc" inside of the emacs.  And if you 
haven't installed it,

0:11:35.650,0:11:42.500
here's the command that you'll be
typing. So sudo apt-get install erc.

0:11:42.500,0:11:46.810
Now if I do control x 2 to split
and then a control x b

0:11:46.810,0:11:48.020
for buffer

0:11:48.020,0:11:51.740
the default happens to shell whether to go
back to my shell but if i didn't

0:11:51.740,0:11:53.970
actually no i can't tab

0:11:53.970,0:11:57.570
i'll see the possible things will see
that i want to go to store shelves store

0:11:57.570,0:12:00.360
suppressed or aspect pam

0:12:00.360,0:12:01.780
getting closer

0:12:01.780,0:12:05.010
s_a_t_ cult aum and shelled

0:12:05.010,0:12:06.270
jump to the shell

0:12:06.270,0:12:12.700
let's go ahead and just see if we can
install the capsule

0:12:12.700,0:12:17.090
nouns and asking for a password and less
these accidents the bottom and has a

0:12:17.090,0:12:19.910
poor hopefully my password macho

0:12:19.910,0:12:23.840
in this case it's the research tools
password for the personal machine

0:12:23.840,0:12:26.200
and that is

0:12:26.200,0:12:29.310
commemorated is a transmission point
party

0:12:29.310,0:12:31.000
two zero one one

0:12:31.000,0:12:33.620
the agm

0:12:33.620,0:12:39.030
now in my case it's already been
installed and

0:12:39.030,0:12:40.450
insolvent

0:12:40.450,0:12:44.720
but if it hadn't spent it would have
gone ahead and saw a lot tougher for you

0:12:44.720,0:12:47.900
so let's go ahead

0:12:47.900,0:12:48.930
and start up

0:12:48.930,0:12:51.810
the p_r_c_

0:12:51.810,0:12:56.500
pretty common for perot and his men tax
university

0:12:56.500,0:13:01.670
start piracy inside imax

0:13:01.670,0:13:05.560
so what i think you is jump over to the
other buffer cecil where i want to

0:13:05.560,0:13:07.000
appear takeover

0:13:07.000,0:13:09.740
olzu now that tax so escape

0:13:09.740,0:13:11.470
and letter acts

0:13:11.470,0:13:15.190
multi p_r_c_ impressive

0:13:15.190,0:13:17.199
thank you it's going to prompt four

0:13:17.199,0:13:21.459
the server that you want to connect to
and i highly recommend irish sea on fri

0:13:21.459,0:13:25.269
i would because it's a great place to
find all sorts of open-source developers

0:13:25.269,0:13:29.160
if in our case we actually have an
internal on them demonstrate

0:13:29.160,0:13:30.710
and that's called

0:13:30.710,0:13:33.200
research

0:13:33.200,0:13:35.510
tools dot secom dot the nation

0:13:35.510,0:13:39.630
and internal network so if you're not
patsy column on one of our machines

0:13:39.630,0:13:40.759
just follow along

0:13:40.759,0:13:44.020
and use the free hota hai receipt

0:13:44.020,0:13:48.140
and then you pick the port number of a
six six six seven years of

0:13:48.140,0:13:49.960
is the default server

0:13:49.960,0:13:52.710
port number so press enter

0:13:52.710,0:13:56.100
now our next game comes from are

0:13:56.100,0:14:00.240
handing over user inside of the same
research tools is not a good tourists so

0:14:00.240,0:14:02.400
i'm gonna go ahead in taipei

0:14:02.400,0:14:04.620
press center for my nickname

0:14:04.620,0:14:08.370
or heresy server doesn't require a
password someone had concern for the

0:14:08.370,0:14:09.790
password

0:14:09.790,0:14:14.420
and i'm not except for the aristide
server

0:14:14.420,0:14:17.850
what i think you would like to go ahead
and join channel tunnel already exists

0:14:17.850,0:14:20.280
and that's human nature research

0:14:20.280,0:14:22.280
tools

0:14:22.280,0:14:25.740
and i'm now connect up to unit research
tools

0:14:25.740,0:14:27.469
now there is another user unknown

0:14:27.469,0:14:30.430
and i'll see if that usual actually send
you back a message

0:14:30.430,0:14:31.940
this happens to be

0:14:31.940,0:14:32.990
myself

0:14:32.990,0:14:36.560
login from another computer

0:14:36.560,0:14:42.240
and i can say hi

0:14:42.240,0:14:44.660
we're lucky here they go parson hiney

0:14:44.660,0:14:46.460
and we can also say

0:14:46.460,0:14:50.250
kurt colin high and that should appear

0:14:50.250,0:14:54.160
and now what the mostar she clients do
it so i actually show you

0:14:54.160,0:14:54.990
that

0:14:54.990,0:14:58.439
type your name is in here it'll
highlighted so that you were you notice

0:14:58.439,0:15:00.960
when people are talking back to you

0:15:00.960,0:15:04.940
so now you've got harris each act that
you can do within sight of the max

0:15:04.940,0:15:06.160
and you've got

0:15:06.160,0:15:08.660
your directory and it no ten-year shell

0:15:08.660,0:15:11.090
it looks like we've got pretty much
everything you need to

0:15:11.090,0:15:12.449
to get going on

0:15:12.449,0:15:17.550
doing some actual shell scripting so
let's go ahead and jump into

0:15:17.550,0:15:19.470
another topic

0:15:19.470,0:15:21.750
summoned jump back to you

0:15:21.750,0:15:24.760
different offer and see if we got on the
buffers

0:15:24.760,0:15:29.020
and

0:15:29.020,0:15:32.110
simmering here that's my home directory

0:15:32.110,0:15:36.730
research tools i have a shell so here i
mean the shell

0:15:36.730,0:15:41.550
yes i do know special there's just
tutorial dot t_ extn jittery about sixty

0:15:41.550,0:15:43.920
tool dot the backup file

0:15:43.920,0:15:46.250
so let's go ahead and

0:15:46.250,0:15:48.530
open up a shell scripts

0:15:48.530,0:15:51.890
unit control access control of

0:15:51.890,0:15:54.540
and and my file name is going to be

0:15:54.540,0:15:56.230
simple thought

0:15:56.230,0:15:57.880
s_h_

0:15:57.880,0:15:59.100
press enter

0:15:59.100,0:16:03.280
and there's nothing in here now the
first line initial script

0:16:03.280,0:16:05.570
there's a special syntax to use

0:16:05.570,0:16:08.070
ke specify the earring a shell script

0:16:08.070,0:16:10.960
and that's a pound the number sign

0:16:10.960,0:16:12.620
the escalation point

0:16:12.620,0:16:14.100
and then the script

0:16:14.100,0:16:18.470
scripting tool you wanna run so that
could be perot or

0:16:18.470,0:16:21.680
group b_ or placed on our number too

0:16:21.680,0:16:24.360
in our case for any sadat shown

0:16:24.360,0:16:28.770
and now if you noticed there's actually
color on this that we haven't had before

0:16:28.770,0:16:32.390
with scripting languages when you're or
any other program in management imax

0:16:32.390,0:16:34.760
understands that you're in that moment

0:16:34.760,0:16:36.969
you can see here since the shell scripts

0:16:36.969,0:16:39.460
and it now knows that that's okay

0:16:39.460,0:16:43.060
shell script and select color eyes
things based on what i can person the

0:16:43.060,0:16:44.500
tax of three type

0:16:44.500,0:16:46.100
echo

0:16:46.100,0:16:48.000
hello worlds

0:16:48.000,0:16:51.940
now if we cannot mcclellan it would be
just black and white

0:16:51.940,0:16:53.770
and if we have a comment

0:16:53.770,0:16:56.790
comments are inline

0:16:56.790,0:17:00.050
your callers may be different depending
on how your nexus at iop

0:17:00.050,0:17:03.280
but it's great to have coloring to help
show you what's going on

0:17:03.280,0:17:08.000
so we've now say this with control x
control us and i've already stated by

0:17:08.000,0:17:09.220
habit

0:17:09.220,0:17:12.740
and let's go to our other buffered

0:17:12.740,0:17:17.900
and co finer shell thank you and i lost
my cell

0:17:17.900,0:17:23.589
now inside of that shell we can look at
the permissions here

0:17:23.589,0:17:25.840
and this tells me that we have a problem

0:17:25.840,0:17:29.100
my people of are you reading stories but

0:17:29.100,0:17:31.160
letters over on the left tell me

0:17:31.160,0:17:33.620
permissions for the file

0:17:33.620,0:17:37.390
so here it says the owner of the file
can read and write

0:17:37.390,0:17:42.110
anybody in the same group can read and
end-user ounces and can read need to

0:17:42.110,0:17:43.720
change that

0:17:43.720,0:17:45.670
to be executed

0:17:45.670,0:17:50.799
so if you want to execute the script we
can say c_h_a_ mind which is change

0:17:50.799,0:17:52.600
mods

0:17:52.600,0:17:54.780
and we can say

0:17:54.780,0:17:57.120
costs

0:17:57.120,0:17:58.910
execute

0:17:58.910,0:18:02.900
and then we can see our script sample
dot s_h_

0:18:02.900,0:18:08.510
and press enter it's quick change this
template and execute bit replied onto

0:18:08.510,0:18:11.580
the programs that we do know is that
shell sample

0:18:11.580,0:18:13.750
uh... passage

0:18:13.750,0:18:19.690
you now see that it's marked an axe on
every one of those

0:18:19.690,0:18:23.440
weakening around are simple but essays
from the shona

0:18:23.440,0:18:27.260
now if we take simple dot passage

0:18:27.260,0:18:28.670
it's not found

0:18:28.670,0:18:33.380
what's going on here is that we have a
path and color path

0:18:33.380,0:18:36.929
and that path does not include the
current directory

0:18:36.929,0:18:39.500
to get around that weekend to you

0:18:39.500,0:18:44.010
dot slash sample thought xh

0:18:44.010,0:18:46.350
and we've now got our first program

0:18:46.350,0:18:47.940
they were stored on a computer

0:18:47.940,0:18:52.549
and we've run simple but i think units
sent back to us hello world

0:18:52.549,0:18:55.220
now women are always want to do that
maybe you want

0:18:55.220,0:18:59.710
stay with michelle anyone at do it's
actually it called compile

0:18:59.710,0:19:03.210
in this case friesen were compiling a
strange way we're just gonna run as

0:19:03.210,0:19:07.430
correct and that is the actual script so
i made you mad at acts

0:19:07.430,0:19:09.830
compiled

0:19:09.830,0:19:13.690
now wants to run by default something
called make we're gonna ignore that

0:19:13.690,0:19:17.980
and we'll see if we can take simple dot
s_h_

0:19:17.980,0:19:19.580
now didn't find it

0:19:19.580,0:19:23.700
and what we have to do instead is meta
tags

0:19:23.700,0:19:25.880
had compiled

0:19:25.880,0:19:29.700
and then we give its now look at the
control a ruby's keys at work almost

0:19:29.700,0:19:30.880
anywhere

0:19:30.880,0:19:33.760
dot slash sample dot s_h_

0:19:33.760,0:19:36.680
and now we actually have anything

0:19:36.680,0:19:40.130
in the buffer below and the compiler
shin window which really isnt compiling

0:19:40.130,0:19:41.590
a just running for us

0:19:41.590,0:19:44.070
and we can see our script running

0:19:44.070,0:19:46.320
so then we can go in

0:19:46.320,0:19:47.049
and

0:19:47.049,0:19:50.450
keep running our script

0:19:50.450,0:19:51.730
so that works pretty well

0:19:51.730,0:19:55.070
and let's go ahead and create a python
scripts to go along with our shell

0:19:55.070,0:19:55.900
script

0:19:55.900,0:19:57.190
and we'll call it

0:19:57.190,0:20:00.270
simple dot p wife for python

0:20:00.270,0:20:04.230
so now if you look here it says ok were
impact on the road

0:20:04.230,0:20:08.160
into the header for pythons little bit
different the one i tend to use is tries

0:20:08.160,0:20:08.820
to be

0:20:08.820,0:20:10.280

0:20:18.000,0:20:20.080
python program

0:20:20.080,0:20:21.980
and print

0:20:21.980,0:20:23.630
hello

world

0:20:25.620,0:20:28.390
python

0:20:28.390,0:20:30.410
go ahead and say that

0:20:30.410,0:20:31.880
ends

0:20:31.880,0:20:33.880
if we go back to you

0:20:33.880,0:20:35.660
the

0:20:35.660,0:20:38.110
shelves

0:20:38.110,0:20:40.799

perry we had our first report

0:21:09.770,0:21:10.929
now up here

0:21:10.929,0:21:14.950
how we can go ahead and do the same
thing that i can say maddox compile

0:21:14.950,0:21:20.100
and i can change their simple the
passage to sample dot pine

0:21:20.100,0:21:23.870
and i've had to control k here to tell

ron harper transcript

0:21:30.100,0:21:32.850
now there's a hopeful thing when you
start having a lot of scripts and you're

0:21:32.850,0:21:35.510
building up a suite of tools

0:21:35.510,0:21:36.880
and it's called speak bar

0:21:40.000,0:21:42.410
ninety six p_m_ press tab

0:21:42.410,0:21:43.460
completed

0:21:43.460,0:21:44.960
and we now have

0:21:44.960,0:21:46.460
this he knew the widget

0:21:46.460,0:21:52.450
that'll help us maneuver around and our
project

0:21:52.450,0:21:57.140
in the second to reorganize my windows
so i can actually see this thing he and

0:21:57.140,0:22:02.370
united syndrome

0:22:02.370,0:22:06.059
now people are eating currently
configured to notice shell scripts

0:22:06.059,0:22:09.290
but it will notice if we have honor
python scripts

0:22:09.290,0:22:14.540
fell into a control acts and w and that
rates to a different file

0:22:14.540,0:22:15.429
sold to you

0:22:15.429,0:22:18.420
simple

0:22:18.420,0:22:21.470
people to tough time

0:22:21.470,0:22:22.330
and

0:22:22.330,0:22:26.669
if you look over on the right magically
speedo resorted to you

0:22:26.669,0:22:29.340
uh... show us a sample to that time

0:22:29.340,0:22:31.150
can't go back to

0:22:31.150,0:22:33.650
are directorate modem hit town

0:22:33.650,0:22:35.960
you control except the

0:22:35.960,0:22:37.309
during that time

0:22:37.309,0:22:41.110
now here's our list of buffers i'm
looking forward to tory only answered

0:22:41.110,0:22:44.420
retreated tutorial to you

0:22:44.420,0:22:44.970
and

0:22:44.970,0:22:48.960
this is way out of determine oppressed
g_m_ will catch up here

0:22:48.960,0:22:53.580
so you can see here that we do have a
simple torres h

0:22:53.580,0:22:54.690
and that's

0:22:54.690,0:22:59.210
and not showing up in the city parks was
just showing us our python scripts

0:22:59.210,0:23:00.140
zarate head

0:23:00.140,0:23:03.279
i'm sure you can configure it to you
show shell scripts to you

0:23:03.279,0:23:06.180
but uh... that the other their time

0:23:06.180,0:23:07.299
let's go ahead

0:23:07.299,0:23:08.270
and

0:23:08.270,0:23:12.610
out make a mistake in our python scripts

0:23:12.610,0:23:14.240
what am i

0:23:14.240,0:23:15.730
doing

0:23:15.730,0:23:18.000
that we try to run the script

0:23:18.000,0:23:19.780
and if we go over here

0:23:19.780,0:23:24.179
and i will notice this is not executed
wilson and go to the immediate

0:23:24.179,0:23:29.149
and we'll see if i can find

0:23:29.149,0:23:30.030
operates

0:23:30.030,0:23:32.200
center here

0:23:32.200,0:23:34.640
change mowing

0:23:34.640,0:23:36.010
capital time

0:23:36.010,0:23:38.000
can't

0:23:38.000,0:23:41.440
i'm guessing here that i have type in
the binary numbers there was a little

0:23:41.440,0:23:42.529
less than fun

0:23:42.529,0:23:44.510
don't have seven five five

0:23:44.510,0:23:49.580
which is the way to have a read write
execute breed executing read execute and

0:23:49.580,0:23:52.520
they're just like the other ones

0:23:52.520,0:23:56.740
info that you can go ahead and go way
back to that show into a c_h_ mon plus

0:23:56.740,0:23:58.630
packs

0:23:58.630,0:24:02.179
let's go ahead and run the script cement
acts

0:24:02.179,0:24:04.280
compile

0:24:04.280,0:24:07.140
endometriosis to be simple to

0:24:07.140,0:24:09.890
and it's going to have an error

0:24:09.890,0:24:11.930
figures show ever seen

0:24:11.930,0:24:12.880
pipeline

0:24:12.880,0:24:14.770
telling us that on line five

0:24:14.770,0:24:18.029
it didn't like what am i doing question
mark

0:24:18.029,0:24:19.540
and when we continue

0:24:19.540,0:24:24.220
is is actually coming in to jump to the
next here mass control x and that's the

0:24:24.220,0:24:29.560
backhoe his tacky begins with the till
the right about the time

0:24:29.560,0:24:33.210
and it will jump to the next problem why
so if you're a large set of code and the

0:24:33.210,0:24:35.880
typo or problem of some sort

0:24:35.880,0:24:39.770
you can then jump through those problems
and affix them markets walter's comment

0:24:39.770,0:24:43.300
that out

0:24:43.300,0:24:47.169
so that's pretty exciting in terms of
being able to run scripts

0:24:47.169,0:24:51.580
and we also unable search across
multiple things so let's try to come and

0:24:51.580,0:24:55.850
who we can actually have i'd grab that
spills into

0:24:55.850,0:24:57.289
he met

0:24:57.289,0:25:01.990
and let's go ahead and and run mena acts
groove references research across the

0:25:01.990,0:25:03.640
directory

0:25:03.640,0:25:05.500
and that we will say

0:25:05.500,0:25:06.650
plant

0:25:06.650,0:25:13.650
and storks soar in a search for the word
printed in any file in this directory

0:25:13.720,0:25:17.350
and what we've got here is this the
examples that show nuns

0:25:17.350,0:25:20.350
and we can click on one and it will take
us to it

0:25:20.350,0:25:22.470
we can also use that go to next

0:25:22.470,0:25:24.539
here and and control act

0:25:24.539,0:25:29.109
back quote and it will jump to the next
morning to see the arab moved down and

0:25:29.109,0:25:31.990
the files changed control x that quote

0:25:31.990,0:25:36.280
have now moved through all three files
unseemly to the instance of print

0:25:36.280,0:25:41.809
seeking a search around manipulated and
work with a wide range of files

0:25:41.809,0:25:42.830
hope you enjoyed it

0:25:42.830,0:25:44.990
the school's to recruitment he

0:25:44.990,0:25:46.590
into building more to come thank you
