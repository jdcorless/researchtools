0:00:01.649,0:00:05.560
hello my name is courage where and today
i'll be showing you

0:00:05.560,0:00:09.649
our research tools video number eleven
python perfor

0:00:09.649,0:00:11.249
and i'll be talking about

0:00:11.249,0:00:16.529
the if construct while loops and
command-line arguments

0:00:16.529,0:00:20.200
and will be did farther in the python
last time we talked about

0:00:20.200,0:00:21.420
assignments function

0:00:21.420,0:00:25.189
ends and classes could be a building on
those

0:00:25.189,0:00:27.390
so put up high pipeline

0:00:27.390,0:00:29.810
show inside and

0:00:29.810,0:00:35.500
permanent sold to typewriter on which is
our against child the regular papon

0:00:35.500,0:00:36.860
and

0:00:36.860,0:00:38.320
dash dash

0:00:38.320,0:00:40.930
thailand

0:00:40.930,0:00:45.539
than our inside as i a python shell and
let's take a quick look have the

0:00:45.539,0:00:47.880
if construct that lets you ask

0:00:47.880,0:00:48.879
yes no question

0:00:48.879,0:00:51.930
means and make decisions based on that

0:00:51.930,0:00:54.169
uh... let's take a quick drive-through

0:00:54.169,0:00:55.440
the basic if

0:00:55.440,0:00:56.600
syntax

0:00:56.600,0:00:58.010
will say gift

0:00:58.010,0:01:03.760
and then you give a true or false
mistakes were disconnected troop

0:01:03.760,0:01:05.310
yes

0:01:05.310,0:01:06.520
press enter

0:01:06.520,0:01:10.980
i remember hearing type on that
indentation controls our blocks of this

0:01:10.980,0:01:13.390
indentation start of the block

0:01:13.390,0:01:15.220
and then all blank line

0:01:15.220,0:01:16.890
ended up

0:01:16.890,0:01:19.810
so what happened here is we had if
passed

0:01:19.810,0:01:24.080
uh... expression or thing that was
evaluated its true or false comes in

0:01:24.080,0:01:26.740
next haven't followed up with the colon

0:01:26.740,0:01:30.820
and then if that's true what's in here
is ron phillips to the

0:01:30.820,0:01:32.770
profits will say if

0:01:32.770,0:01:34.720
false

0:01:34.720,0:01:36.050
print

0:01:36.050,0:01:37.020
yes

0:01:37.020,0:01:37.979
now in this case

0:01:37.979,0:01:41.999
or not dennis the printed because this
is false and so what's inside his mouth

0:01:41.999,0:01:43.810
around

0:01:43.810,0:01:45.170
so there was no

0:01:45.170,0:01:46.710
uh... yes

0:01:46.710,0:01:51.530
now lets out put that together we can
also have a case for uh... if true we

0:01:51.530,0:01:55.360
could also have a house if it's falsely
to take care

0:01:55.360,0:01:56.930
true

0:01:56.930,0:01:57.860
print

0:01:57.860,0:02:02.259
yes

0:02:02.259,0:02:04.899
back appear cults

0:02:04.899,0:02:08.609
and print

0:02:08.609,0:02:12.379
so in this case since this is true is
gonna print yes it is not educating

0:02:12.379,0:02:14.589
themselves blocks will try to have

0:02:14.589,0:02:16.930
amplitude yes

0:02:16.930,0:02:20.559
and i have apparent weisman going back
and at this here

0:02:20.559,0:02:23.839
it's a little bit we're inside i think
one of the editing like this

0:02:23.839,0:02:26.510
so it's a false

0:02:26.510,0:02:28.980
and we'll go ahead and print

0:02:28.980,0:02:30.030
answered and

0:02:30.030,0:02:35.269
it should print no because this is false
or something else

0:02:35.269,0:02:36.030
payens

0:02:36.030,0:02:38.170
then it will continue on through

0:02:38.170,0:02:41.629
temp right now

0:02:41.629,0:02:45.149
now in terms of expressions the kind of
things you can put in there is anything

0:02:45.149,0:02:48.929
you want that if i was a true or false
and that's the tide pools so please stay

0:02:48.929,0:02:50.839
tight

0:02:50.839,0:02:52.729
uh... faults

0:02:52.729,0:02:56.290
comes out to type

0:02:56.290,0:02:59.829
seeking a simple things like this one
equaled one

0:02:59.829,0:03:01.369
the answers true

0:03:01.369,0:03:04.129
is it not equal that's false

0:03:04.129,0:03:04.819
youporn

0:03:04.819,0:03:06.389
greater van

0:03:06.389,0:03:10.719
or prisoner equal to anything along
those lines that if i was a true or

0:03:10.719,0:03:14.539
false it can be uh... while complicate
expressions with lots of pregnancies

0:03:14.539,0:03:17.019
because they wind equals two

0:03:17.019,0:03:18.699
eagle forum

0:03:18.699,0:03:20.989
and to equals two

0:03:20.989,0:03:26.049
this is the logical and operator

0:03:26.049,0:03:28.789
conceded not here recipient

0:03:28.789,0:03:31.949
and also say

0:03:31.949,0:03:36.319
or

0:03:36.319,0:03:38.759
seeking for a whole range of expression
so

0:03:38.759,0:03:39.559
here

0:03:39.559,0:03:43.810
one does not equal to one and two cycles
to use the word testing

0:03:43.810,0:03:47.789
various things that you can also do you
some fun string comparisons

0:03:47.789,0:03:49.169
we can say

0:03:49.169,0:03:51.099
is

0:03:51.099,0:03:52.409
hell

0:03:52.409,0:03:54.049
in

0:03:54.049,0:03:55.239
hello

0:03:55.239,0:03:57.739
world

0:03:57.739,0:04:01.739
seeking to string test where you can say
is something inside of

0:04:01.739,0:04:05.199
about how we can also do things like

0:04:05.199,0:04:07.900
let's say four and

0:04:07.900,0:04:09.629
wind

0:04:09.629,0:04:11.799
seven

0:04:11.799,0:04:14.219
false but that if we threw off

0:04:14.219,0:04:15.869
for analyst

0:04:15.869,0:04:18.820
then force actually inside of our list

0:04:18.820,0:04:22.270
so we can do some simple tests about
things and we can look for patterns and

0:04:22.270,0:04:24.710
strings

0:04:24.710,0:04:28.389
three simple but it gets a lot of time
there's also a really handy

0:04:28.389,0:04:31.090
and new functionality impact on that
wasn't there

0:04:31.090,0:04:32.639
all along

0:04:32.639,0:04:34.659
at something like a statement

0:04:34.659,0:04:35.650
that lets you

0:04:35.650,0:04:38.089
composed stuff so they can say

0:04:38.089,0:04:41.309
with the right equal

0:04:41.309,0:04:44.630
if more when he calls zero

0:04:44.630,0:04:46.949
adults

0:04:46.949,0:04:49.090
not really

0:04:49.090,0:04:53.150
kal

0:04:53.150,0:04:55.630
and what this is as you have a statement

0:04:55.630,0:04:58.580
that will get returned

0:04:58.580,0:05:01.479
this is true otherwise

0:05:01.479,0:05:04.100
it's gonna return

0:05:04.100,0:05:04.820
and

0:05:04.820,0:05:11.020
what you can do with that if you can do
simple things like

0:05:11.020,0:05:13.079
warranty cool

0:05:13.079,0:05:16.339
zero

0:05:16.339,0:05:19.389
is

0:05:19.389,0:05:26.389

0:05:26.690,0:05:27.979

0:05:30.139,0:05:31.889
and more tax

0:05:31.889,0:05:33.659
c cancer building up

0:05:33.659,0:05:37.110
westchester knows and things like that
based on your daily cash anecdotal

0:05:37.110,0:05:38.549
reports that

0:05:38.549,0:05:41.089
that make a nicely formatted report out
of

0:05:41.089,0:05:42.460
your result

0:05:42.460,0:05:45.460
soaking here are a little string got put
in there

0:05:45.460,0:05:52.460
and everyone that and it's a

0:05:54.069,0:05:56.150
this then changed course

0:05:56.150,0:05:59.249
so you can get this really nice things
like yes or no

0:05:59.249,0:06:03.789
and other such things as you do your
reports they worked pretty well

0:06:03.789,0:06:06.199
uh...

0:06:06.199,0:06:09.169
and you can also view sign it's a very
bills that we've heard this week so we

0:06:09.169,0:06:12.159
can stay in service

0:06:12.159,0:06:14.110
uh... he calls

0:06:14.110,0:06:16.100
yes here

0:06:16.100,0:06:17.750
true

0:06:17.750,0:06:23.870
zip reporting if they could see it
corrupts else

0:06:23.870,0:06:24.639
answer

0:06:24.639,0:06:25.810
yes

0:06:25.810,0:06:28.069
and if we did

0:06:28.069,0:06:31.360
through its false still say

0:06:31.360,0:06:33.770
and in

0:06:33.770,0:06:35.769
come before coming

0:06:35.769,0:06:38.120
six

0:06:38.120,0:06:40.620
cancer

0:06:40.620,0:06:41.519
and that way

0:06:41.519,0:06:44.229
it worked really well for being able to
you

0:06:44.229,0:06:49.139
uh... create some quick variables that
you can use later on

0:06:49.139,0:06:50.290
uh... okay

0:06:50.290,0:06:54.639
so let's go over to you

0:06:54.639,0:06:56.090
are

0:06:56.090,0:06:57.529
peanuts window

0:06:57.529,0:06:58.480
animated

0:06:58.480,0:07:00.819
jump over to our

0:07:00.819,0:07:04.169
display here and we're gonna go ahead
and try and work with some command-line

0:07:04.169,0:07:05.319
arguments

0:07:05.319,0:07:06.099
and

0:07:06.099,0:07:07.909
uh... for a look at

0:07:07.909,0:07:10.849
some simple things were as they tried

0:07:10.849,0:07:12.999
arg stockpiled

0:07:12.999,0:07:14.770
yourselves a little thing

0:07:14.770,0:07:16.219
in israeli girl

0:07:16.219,0:07:16.919
and

0:07:16.919,0:07:20.439
there's a special variable and placed on
that helps you work with running

0:07:20.439,0:07:21.519
programs

0:07:21.519,0:07:25.509
so if we

0:07:25.509,0:07:26.939
name

0:07:26.939,0:07:30.549
this is a very special variable that
changes its value depending on where it

0:07:30.549,0:07:32.029
is if it's in there

0:07:32.029,0:07:34.090
international running program

0:07:34.090,0:07:36.400
uh... it's actually in

0:07:36.400,0:07:40.499
set two main but if it's inside of a
module when it's being called itself the

0:07:40.499,0:07:41.819
module name

0:07:41.819,0:07:45.009
so we'll go ahead and stay

0:07:45.009,0:07:48.129
underscores for name controller scored

0:07:48.129,0:07:51.780
inside of our trek art

0:07:51.780,0:07:53.509
and if we

0:07:53.509,0:07:54.780
run

0:07:54.780,0:07:56.840
try args

0:07:56.840,0:07:58.310
you'll see that sets in maine

0:07:58.310,0:08:02.349
but if we do imports try args

0:08:02.349,0:08:03.810
it's set to

0:08:03.810,0:08:09.650
the name of the module which is charged
three sinking as the final down here

0:08:09.650,0:08:13.030
so what we can do in fact as we can say
if

0:08:13.030,0:08:15.089
underscore name

0:08:15.089,0:08:17.129
because

0:08:17.129,0:08:21.379
main

0:08:21.379,0:08:23.300
too

0:08:23.300,0:08:25.419
policy act

0:08:25.419,0:08:27.379
whitey program

0:08:27.379,0:08:29.639
otherwise

0:08:29.639,0:08:33.669
uh... don't do that and acts like a
module if you just load so we can say

0:08:33.669,0:08:36.410
print

0:08:36.410,0:08:38.000
and we can put that

0:08:38.000,0:08:39.340
inside of there

0:08:39.340,0:08:42.080
so we can say

0:08:42.080,0:08:43.950
we wanted to get main back

0:08:43.950,0:08:47.770
and if we and now we have to review
reloaded

0:08:47.770,0:08:52.060
uh... trying cards because this is a
module and once thought it it stays in

0:08:52.060,0:08:56.430
the most u_s_ chetori voted to keep
important

0:08:56.430,0:08:59.250
and if you didn't print anything out of
stock

0:08:59.250,0:09:04.210
so it's very unique and white typically
tend to do with programs will say make a

0:09:04.210,0:09:06.180
function called main

0:09:06.180,0:09:11.620
animals say data

0:09:11.620,0:09:14.560
expert name

0:09:14.560,0:09:15.730
and that way

0:09:15.730,0:09:19.630
you have a function that you can use in
the cancer really try arts and you could

0:09:19.630,0:09:24.130
always caught from inside of here
working to try it works main

0:09:24.130,0:09:26.210
and we have are sort of me

0:09:26.210,0:09:30.320
so we have that option available to its
whatever it was like

0:09:30.320,0:09:34.570
very handy but let's take a look at me
and my arguments him for a start looking

0:09:34.570,0:09:38.630
into the standard library to come to a
place on its it's chock full of helpful

0:09:38.630,0:09:39.870
utilities

0:09:39.870,0:09:41.580
and we're gonna comport

0:09:41.580,0:09:45.690
six two six module contains all sorts of
system related stuff

0:09:45.690,0:09:50.760
success period in the region pressed
having and see lots of

0:09:50.760,0:09:54.440
things are insiders how module space

0:09:54.440,0:09:58.010
and who only want is partly

0:09:58.010,0:10:00.210
amplitude party question mark

0:10:00.210,0:10:04.880
that it's actually a list sister harvey
let's take a look what's in there

0:10:04.880,0:10:08.400
these are the command line arguments
that we used for calling our python

0:10:08.400,0:10:09.390
script

0:10:09.390,0:10:12.940
so let's go ahead king and in here

0:10:12.940,0:10:17.710
for clinton import taxes a typically you
put your imports for a particular file i

0:10:17.710,0:10:19.590
thought at the top

0:10:19.590,0:10:22.660
analyst take a look at

0:10:22.660,0:10:25.070
psystar party

0:10:25.070,0:10:28.640
and what does that can it be equal to so
will go ahead and tied

0:10:28.640,0:10:32.450
system apart the interest of printout
that memory mister coming into our

0:10:32.450,0:10:33.750
script

0:10:33.750,0:10:36.350
and let's go ahead and ron

0:10:36.350,0:10:37.940
try

0:10:37.940,0:10:39.680
so in there

0:10:39.680,0:10:41.990
just for her to meet their and

0:10:41.990,0:10:46.200
with women argument if route back to the
shell scripting sections

0:10:46.200,0:10:48.140
we can put arguments after it

0:10:48.140,0:10:50.170
with israeli hello

0:10:50.170,0:10:51.230
world

0:10:51.230,0:10:54.530
presenter and will now see that it
breaks out into

0:10:54.530,0:10:56.010
one argument

0:10:56.010,0:10:58.690
he states that we have a hell of a world

0:10:58.690,0:11:01.220
we could have two members want to you

0:11:01.220,0:11:03.000
one thousand

0:11:03.000,0:11:06.250
and weakened and work with those

0:11:06.250,0:11:09.670
pretty he needs to be a list of file
names that could be a list of say

0:11:09.670,0:11:14.190
computers to connect to you working to
process for jobs that you

0:11:14.190,0:11:16.220
to be any number of things

0:11:16.220,0:11:19.700
and this is the very simple wages
crossing manner and so what we could do

0:11:19.700,0:11:21.290
this we can say

0:11:21.290,0:11:25.220
for

0:11:25.220,0:11:26.870
argument may be easier

0:11:26.870,0:11:30.410
in system argh

0:11:30.410,0:11:33.020
and print

0:11:33.020,0:11:37.970
pertinent

0:11:37.970,0:11:41.270
so go ahead and we'll get that fixed
right

0:11:41.270,0:11:44.870
and you can see in argument karate to
those things

0:11:44.870,0:11:47.720
and remember in python we can actually
uh...

0:11:47.720,0:11:51.050
count those if you want to make it
speaking numerator that really can t

0:11:51.050,0:11:52.099
functions

0:11:52.099,0:11:55.030
contract brennan's a list of things

0:11:55.030,0:11:59.650
and then we can say

0:11:59.650,0:12:00.529
uh...

0:12:00.529,0:12:03.120
underscored the killed readable

0:12:03.120,0:12:05.600
and

0:12:05.600,0:12:09.970
satis hard

0:12:09.970,0:12:12.530
org

0:12:12.530,0:12:15.980
so for running this it's going to look
through it it'll put in the argument

0:12:15.980,0:12:17.210
number here

0:12:17.210,0:12:18.720
and in the apartment and

0:12:18.720,0:12:19.960
and arguments

0:12:19.960,0:12:21.670
and lived through each time

0:12:21.670,0:12:24.450
and right

0:12:24.450,0:12:27.570
making to you interesting things there's
uh...

0:12:27.570,0:12:28.540
continuing

0:12:28.540,0:12:30.980
is a

0:12:30.980,0:12:33.430
function that

0:12:33.430,0:12:35.440
at the reserve were that you can call

0:12:35.440,0:12:41.880
that will jump around the loop if you
forget something so we can say

0:12:41.880,0:12:45.390
hell

0:12:45.390,0:12:47.860
in

0:12:47.860,0:12:51.560
argument soren test to see if

0:12:51.560,0:12:56.080
though the word helen's inside of that
string

0:12:56.080,0:12:58.340
hanging in here

0:12:58.340,0:13:00.980
one cents with our continuing

0:13:00.980,0:13:04.160
and annual have uh... quick

0:13:04.160,0:13:05.689
jump around so we need it

0:13:05.689,0:13:08.310
this if you see hal inside of the line

0:13:08.310,0:13:11.130
it comes down here jumps into this
section

0:13:11.130,0:13:15.160
pat calls the continue looking teen
doesnt is skipping this below uh... jump

0:13:15.160,0:13:17.050
up to the top

0:13:17.050,0:13:22.780
are hello parties disappear from this
list let's go ahead and try it

0:13:22.780,0:13:25.710
and so up hello disappeared

0:13:25.710,0:13:31.160
and if you can make a little bit more
obvious prince

0:13:31.160,0:13:35.530
skip

0:13:35.530,0:13:38.540
try that and could see a print skip
allen

0:13:38.540,0:13:42.880
so this way you can loop around and what
we can also do is you can

0:13:42.880,0:13:44.509
you something called breaking

0:13:44.509,0:13:47.790
and break will completely break out of
the four-legged animal style continues

0:13:47.790,0:13:50.370
it won't continue on the table test

0:13:50.370,0:13:52.090
jump right out of it

0:13:52.090,0:13:54.260
will save print

0:13:54.260,0:13:56.120
tonya

0:13:56.120,0:13:57.780
well for

0:13:57.780,0:14:00.140
suing over time with her for live here

0:14:00.140,0:14:01.450
most a_t_f_

0:14:01.450,0:14:04.910
too

0:14:04.910,0:14:10.740
and arguments

0:14:10.740,0:14:15.590
to print

0:14:15.590,0:14:20.150
so what this will do it when it sees it
number two you inside of that string

0:14:20.150,0:14:23.680
what it will do and that's the character
to not be actually jer

0:14:23.680,0:14:25.640
it will then print give up

0:14:25.640,0:14:27.000
the breakthrough will

0:14:27.000,0:14:29.240
jump back at this for a loop till the
end of this

0:14:29.240,0:14:31.130
the poorly did not do the rest of it

0:14:31.130,0:14:33.300
and jump down to the print at the bottom

0:14:33.300,0:14:36.320
let's go ahead and try this

0:14:36.320,0:14:37.329
run

0:14:37.329,0:14:39.100
and if we take a look here

0:14:39.100,0:14:41.320
we start off with are

0:14:41.320,0:14:43.950
printed sort of maine right there

0:14:43.950,0:14:47.060
then we're gonna hit

0:14:47.060,0:14:52.890
proved to be argue so of arguments cup
ran out on this one right here

0:14:52.890,0:14:55.990
and now before that starts came

0:14:55.990,0:14:59.010
border first argument here

0:14:59.010,0:15:03.720
will come through they'd hell is not in
our argument

0:15:03.720,0:15:07.700
she was not an argument so we're going
to print and arguments which is right

0:15:07.700,0:15:08.610
here

0:15:08.610,0:15:11.060
come back around we have hello

0:15:11.060,0:15:14.110
and hello is in the ordinance will print

0:15:14.110,0:15:14.970
are

0:15:14.970,0:15:16.260
skip help

0:15:16.260,0:15:20.160
and then we'll say continue which just
the top and keeps going

0:15:20.160,0:15:24.380
come back through it we have world walsh
will use the sprints down here

0:15:24.380,0:15:28.170
and argument one yep that comes early
and a prince

0:15:28.170,0:15:32.550
inhabit do inner strength

0:15:32.550,0:15:35.980
the heck if two argument yet so will
give up

0:15:35.980,0:15:37.120
and

0:15:37.120,0:15:39.510
call this break which was going to hear

0:15:39.510,0:15:43.160
exit how to perform moved out to our
print

0:15:43.160,0:15:46.010
and then you're program

0:15:46.010,0:15:50.450
so that's the basics of nehemiah are
crossing we be brought back the for loop

0:15:50.450,0:15:51.500
a little bit

0:15:51.500,0:15:55.080
and review some of our guest s

0:15:55.080,0:15:57.319
she's quite nice uh... now

0:15:57.319,0:16:01.960
a couple things to look at it and tight
on is there's this r_e_m_ python

0:16:01.960,0:16:03.440
menu item of the top

0:16:03.440,0:16:07.320
and right now it just says a recent
let's go ahead and

0:16:07.320,0:16:09.590
riskin

0:16:09.590,0:16:11.960
and what i did is it looks through

0:16:11.960,0:16:13.980
are

0:16:13.980,0:16:16.770
and tried to find anything that you
about dedicated

0:16:16.770,0:16:18.129
give us as a hanger

0:16:18.129,0:16:22.100
hanger to tack to jump to use of these
are markers out functions classes things

0:16:22.100,0:16:23.400
like that

0:16:23.400,0:16:26.000
so if we say

0:16:26.000,0:16:27.580
hello

0:16:27.580,0:16:31.320
worlds

0:16:31.320,0:16:32.129
poll

0:16:32.129,0:16:34.470
world

0:16:34.470,0:16:36.420
i am python doesn't have it

0:16:36.420,0:16:38.100
at the hickory scam

0:16:38.100,0:16:41.990
it now has hello world so it knows about
what's in your file

0:16:41.990,0:16:43.940
went three standard

0:16:43.940,0:16:47.240
uh... now which also say

0:16:47.240,0:16:48.620
mine

0:16:48.620,0:16:49.990
list

0:16:49.990,0:16:54.400
equals one and

0:16:54.400,0:16:59.430
we've got some western cleary skinless

0:16:59.430,0:17:04.029
there's nothing in there so if we go
over to believe it's tools

0:17:04.029,0:17:08.830
you wanna make sure you turn on self
source code per search semantic

0:17:08.830,0:17:12.010
with this is is extra functionality that
lets it

0:17:12.010,0:17:14.429
understand your source code

0:17:14.429,0:17:15.949
turnout on

0:17:15.949,0:17:19.480
and will go ahead and put risky and if
this works

0:17:19.480,0:17:23.620
and now it knows a lot more about your
coded knows about variables

0:17:23.620,0:17:25.520
so there's my list again

0:17:25.520,0:17:27.750
jump to that mylist

0:17:27.750,0:17:32.330
functions in owes a lot all the
functions we can't jump to main

0:17:32.330,0:17:33.980
and minku

0:17:33.980,0:17:35.759
imports it flows into art

0:17:35.759,0:17:37.750
importance

0:17:37.750,0:17:39.700
hard coded knows about

0:17:39.700,0:17:42.600
cinder blocks we've got to talk to him

0:17:42.600,0:17:45.440
so it's our biggest block down here

0:17:45.440,0:17:47.150
and what this is

0:17:47.150,0:17:50.640
is a helper to get you around the files
it's figure we've been working with very

0:17:50.640,0:17:52.520
tiny files at this point

0:17:52.520,0:17:56.080
and they haven't spent big enough to
really need to have

0:17:56.080,0:17:58.370
helpers to find what square peg

0:17:58.370,0:18:02.340
insanity max there's a lot of tools to
help you manage your code and figure out

0:18:02.340,0:18:04.169
what's where

0:18:04.169,0:18:07.970
now i'm actually a couple of things to
help you break after code and to to make

0:18:07.970,0:18:10.299
it more usable

0:18:10.299,0:18:14.120
there's a couple things you can do one
of which is just style once if if say

0:18:14.120,0:18:17.170
you want to put a comment to break
things up

0:18:17.170,0:18:19.470
we can do something like this so i mean

0:18:19.470,0:18:22.220
teach you first a quick imax

0:18:22.220,0:18:25.390
proper which is control you

0:18:25.390,0:18:29.700
which is uh... a repeat of court
arguments g so if it if we just use

0:18:29.700,0:18:33.200
control you and then i care for every
type normally the repeat that character

0:18:33.200,0:18:35.429
four times a minute patent

0:18:35.429,0:18:37.390
for the comment

0:18:37.390,0:18:40.260
and it will do for the default is for

0:18:40.260,0:18:41.830
politically what for

0:18:41.830,0:18:43.140
will do control you

0:18:43.140,0:18:44.480
forty

0:18:44.480,0:18:46.680
so four zero

0:18:46.680,0:18:49.080
and in the pound character

0:18:49.080,0:18:51.430
and there will then be

0:18:51.430,0:18:54.030
pound signs

0:18:54.030,0:18:57.890
and you can use something like that to
break apart your code if it helps you

0:18:57.890,0:19:01.450
huseyni logical groups of things they do
you have a couple functions that are

0:19:01.450,0:19:04.380
together

0:19:04.380,0:19:11.380
and of world

0:19:15.010,0:19:16.060
so in this case

0:19:16.060,0:19:21.490
we've now logically blocked arco depart
and equal to a bigger one here so you

0:19:21.490,0:19:23.270
seventy

0:19:23.270,0:19:25.020
and then talent

0:19:25.020,0:19:27.480
arbuckle

0:19:27.480,0:19:29.080
if test at the bottom

0:19:29.080,0:19:30.760
so we don't have

0:19:30.760,0:19:34.560
animal to hunt impact on a risky and
then you'll see now we have functions we

0:19:34.560,0:19:37.460
can jump two things this way

0:19:37.460,0:19:42.300
or you can see them logically on the
screen with these visual separators in

0:19:42.300,0:19:44.670
there to help out

0:19:44.670,0:19:48.800
now python also has helpers and these
are called talks to ring to help you

0:19:48.800,0:19:53.720
understand some of what's going on
sophie you did

0:19:53.720,0:19:55.270
sess

0:19:55.270,0:19:59.660
missus module with and tell you all
sorts of documentation about itself

0:19:59.660,0:20:03.330
now that's actually stored inside of the
python source code and we can write her

0:20:03.330,0:20:06.800
own dark strings so if we see reload

0:20:06.800,0:20:09.680
try are xd

0:20:09.680,0:20:11.940
speech were on a diet or

0:20:11.940,0:20:15.690
for for art period and that's haven't

0:20:15.690,0:20:17.970
we can now see that

0:20:17.970,0:20:21.070
we have a mixture of things
unfortunately we've got some stuff from

0:20:21.070,0:20:22.740
coming from her directory

0:20:22.740,0:20:24.290
we've also got

0:20:24.290,0:20:27.270
some of our functions in here can say

0:20:27.270,0:20:28.510
hello world

0:20:28.510,0:20:29.680
question mark

0:20:29.680,0:20:32.970
and that what it says here is that
there's no docs tracks one still create

0:20:32.970,0:20:36.659
what's called the doc string for hello
world

0:20:36.659,0:20:39.140
after the first line of any function

0:20:39.140,0:20:44.190
work last or right after variable we can
create the scarlet talks trying

0:20:44.190,0:20:49.270
documentation string explains what's in
there

0:20:49.270,0:20:53.190
and in our case this function is pretty
boring but the idea is because uh...

0:20:53.190,0:20:56.330
nice and especially if you've got like
math or

0:20:56.330,0:20:59.369
simpson while contest going on so to
function at your work

0:20:59.369,0:21:01.100
hiding behind the scenes

0:21:01.100,0:21:04.080
it's good to you purpose in here so
print

0:21:04.080,0:21:09.100
hello world

0:21:09.100,0:21:13.440
so let's go ahead and save dont and
we'll come back here and will say

0:21:13.440,0:21:18.520
realtor aren't animal hit the apparel
and was asking again for that doctoring

0:21:18.520,0:21:21.750
so now you can see rihanna documentation
string

0:21:21.750,0:21:25.960
and that's pretty handy

0:21:25.960,0:21:29.870
if uh... one line doesn't get to it for
you because often times you need lots of

0:21:29.870,0:21:33.070
instructions to explain things we can
say

0:21:33.070,0:21:36.210
this is eight multi

0:21:36.210,0:21:39.010
line description

0:21:39.010,0:21:41.150
right lots

0:21:41.150,0:21:43.770
lots about c

0:21:43.770,0:21:46.240
function

0:21:46.240,0:21:51.100
so in this case we've used the python
tripleco conventions do a multi line

0:21:51.100,0:21:52.840
string

0:21:52.840,0:21:55.309
so the string starts right here and
hands

0:21:55.309,0:21:57.309
down here

0:21:57.309,0:22:01.039
and moved it lets you write as much as
you want them below so will go ahead and

0:22:01.039,0:22:03.700
reload

0:22:03.700,0:22:04.890
demo tape

0:22:04.890,0:22:06.620
uh... troy

0:22:06.620,0:22:09.000
parks dot

0:22:09.000,0:22:12.220
tom and reduce birth name

0:22:12.220,0:22:15.000
and let's ask it for help on that one

0:22:15.000,0:22:21.470
and so now you can see that there's
multiple lines of help written there

0:22:21.470,0:22:24.750
writing good documentation is so
important how when you're just messing

0:22:24.750,0:22:27.670
around trying to figure something out
may pop in at the time to write

0:22:27.670,0:22:31.690
documentation before you walk away from
your coding let it sit for

0:22:31.690,0:22:33.730
days weeks months years

0:22:33.730,0:22:36.910
then you should be racing doctor-patient
making sure that

0:22:36.910,0:22:39.080
everything that you do is explains

0:22:39.080,0:22:41.100
what may be obvious to you today

0:22:41.100,0:22:44.650
is not likely obvious to you in years to
come or

0:22:44.650,0:22:46.020
uh... to other people

0:22:46.020,0:22:49.840
it's important to be with you that

0:22:49.840,0:22:52.379
and uh... i think that's all we have for
now

0:22:52.379,0:22:56.309
this should get you going on creating
someplace on code

0:22:56.309,0:22:59.450
we're gonna do a couple more concerts
and then delete into you actually

0:22:59.450,0:23:02.370
