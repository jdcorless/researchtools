hello my name is courage where and this
is video seven

0:00:05.359,0:00:07.730
for research tools two thousand levin

0:00:07.730,0:00:12.420
this video will be on python slash i
clicked on hands in the first part no

0:00:12.420,0:00:13.919
introduction

0:00:13.919,0:00:15.339
to working with

0:00:15.339,0:00:19.880
i found from the terminal

0:00:19.880,0:00:24.650
karyam inside of you going to and i will
start up not python but i typed on the

0:00:24.650,0:00:27.699
extended child

0:00:27.699,0:00:31.030
to hear an insight about tight on this
is the first time running

0:00:31.030,0:00:34.500
it's going to ask you about uh... santer

0:00:34.500,0:00:37.630
let's jump rate into right on

0:00:37.630,0:00:39.370
i want bash plate on it

0:00:39.370,0:00:43.240
a lot more uniform and hopefully it'll
be a lot easier for you to pick up and

0:00:43.240,0:00:45.190
scripts

0:00:45.190,0:00:47.970
foot start off with working with some
strings

0:00:47.970,0:00:49.930
entitled

0:00:49.930,0:00:56.330
this is a stirring we put them inside of
single quotes or double quotes

0:00:56.330,0:00:57.930
aureus

0:00:57.930,0:01:02.980
double quote character and i stick with
single quotes just for consistency

0:01:02.980,0:01:04.809
dot com character

0:01:04.809,0:01:06.220
is any comment

0:01:06.220,0:01:10.320
you'll see me sometimes taken comment

0:01:10.320,0:01:14.410
there's a lot of functionality rake in
the to geico

0:01:14.410,0:01:17.770
we can say

0:01:17.770,0:01:24.200
means he is a strength plus space
ministering

0:01:24.200,0:01:26.680
foster

0:01:26.680,0:01:29.280
is a no shift

0:01:29.280,0:01:30.820
can we get back to string

0:01:30.820,0:01:32.159
nancy foster

0:01:32.159,0:01:36.530
so you can take strings and
concatenation together with the plus

0:01:36.530,0:01:40.070
we can also

0:01:40.070,0:01:43.049
sucked into a variable so ship name

0:01:43.049,0:01:45.550
people

0:01:45.550,0:01:50.470
nancy

0:01:50.470,0:01:55.560
and then we can print out anti foster

0:01:55.560,0:01:57.080
ship name

0:01:57.080,0:01:59.130
there is saved as dot

0:01:59.130,0:02:03.600
we can't ask typed on what type of
things in a terrible as ship name

0:02:03.600,0:02:04.760
center

0:02:04.760,0:02:08.219
returns uske arming string

0:02:08.219,0:02:14.859
so some very basic of strings one of our
media types become free with tong

0:02:14.859,0:02:19.730
and basically strings are a sequence of
characters so it's a shipping

0:02:19.730,0:02:22.299
equals

0:02:22.299,0:02:27.930
coastal

0:02:27.930,0:02:29.489
so that we have a string

0:02:29.489,0:02:31.709
the castro blamed uh...

0:02:31.709,0:02:36.579
shipping them out at the same jackie
press tab for indian completion

0:02:36.579,0:02:39.609
phantom

0:02:39.609,0:02:42.849
will tell us how many characters are and
mastering

0:02:42.849,0:02:47.999
we can ask for a particular location in
a strange to recapture

0:02:47.999,0:02:50.019
rate variable in shipping

0:02:50.019,0:02:53.199
the first one is c incomes here

0:02:53.199,0:02:57.859
and we can ask what the characteristic
happens house

0:02:57.859,0:02:58.959
we can also ask

0:02:58.959,0:03:02.979
we're instrument ticular substring or
character

0:03:02.979,0:03:05.069
incidences find

0:03:05.069,0:03:06.149
house

0:03:06.149,0:03:09.449
and tell us that except where the asses
token

0:03:09.449,0:03:10.759
and that's at the

0:03:10.759,0:03:12.619
he'd position

0:03:12.619,0:03:17.399
and we could also say fine the latter
acts which does not occur string

0:03:17.399,0:03:21.309
inherits returns a minus one minute
can't find anything

0:03:21.309,0:03:22.829
we can also ask it

0:03:22.829,0:03:24.169
where

0:03:24.169,0:03:28.210
hefty l spooky northward actual

0:03:28.210,0:03:31.469
chunk of certain characters

0:03:31.469,0:03:34.529
him to start pulling apart the string so
if we know that

0:03:34.529,0:03:38.319
capitalise starts at page position
because they ship name

0:03:38.319,0:03:40.549
and use a square brackets

0:03:40.549,0:03:43.849
address actions of string import apart

0:03:43.849,0:03:45.239
so we can see

0:03:45.239,0:03:46.969
colin

0:03:46.969,0:03:50.819
nine should return cute characters

0:03:50.819,0:03:52.689
excuse me at one time

0:03:52.689,0:03:55.959
and it will return to character it
doesn't return with that uh... after she

0:03:55.959,0:03:58.309
returns up to one before that

0:03:58.309,0:04:00.359
but we can also just retire now

0:04:00.359,0:04:02.139
and it will return to the end

0:04:02.139,0:04:07.099
or we could do the other way around
where there's nothing because to me

0:04:07.099,0:04:10.969
considers the returned call

0:04:10.969,0:04:14.830
we can also address with negative signs
in that will show us from the

0:04:14.830,0:04:19.760
and straying from the right schools list
shipments you can see again and if we go

0:04:19.760,0:04:22.789
ship name

0:04:22.789,0:04:24.449
square bracket

0:04:24.449,0:04:25.200
and

0:04:25.200,0:04:29.630
minus four call themselves the fourth
back to the end

0:04:29.630,0:04:35.889
i think it was the last four characters
string

0:04:35.889,0:04:39.250
just take a quick look at numbers it's
nice to be able to take some numbers and

0:04:39.250,0:04:41.120
you can come we can say

0:04:41.120,0:04:46.499
the number one interns that we'd have to
make sure xsi type one

0:04:46.499,0:04:49.710
recurrences injure we also have

0:04:49.710,0:04:50.910
are real numbers

0:04:50.910,0:04:52.699
so it's a one point one

0:04:52.699,0:04:54.930
and we can ask the type of

0:04:54.930,0:04:56.229
one point one

0:04:56.229,0:04:59.939
is actually a floating-point float

0:04:59.939,0:05:03.749
anti-castro ticket number and term
return string for us

0:05:03.749,0:05:06.949
to the north koreans had no quotes and
we now have a string

0:05:06.949,0:05:09.090
we can also take a string

0:05:09.090,0:05:14.360
and have to turn into a number forests
of three point one four one five

0:05:14.360,0:05:18.660
because my back quarterback actual
number rather than the string

0:05:18.660,0:05:21.889
we can use it for this one

0:05:21.889,0:05:24.360
we can multiply

0:05:24.360,0:05:27.669
you can divide

0:05:27.669,0:05:31.090
the answers are always going to be what
you expected division

0:05:31.090,0:05:32.770
with the divide u

0:05:32.770,0:05:35.799
actually are going to probably want to
do you

0:05:35.799,0:05:39.069
putting twenty five if you actually want
to get fractions of things back

0:05:39.069,0:05:41.330
otherwise it's going to give you

0:05:41.330,0:05:43.279
around down valium

0:05:43.279,0:05:45.879
you can also ask for the remainder so
three

0:05:45.879,0:05:47.310
divided by two

0:05:47.310,0:05:48.520
the remainder is

0:05:48.520,0:05:55.520
one minute that percentage is often
referred to is the mod operator oldie

0:05:55.779,0:05:59.259
equals

0:05:59.259,0:06:02.139
character

0:06:02.139,0:06:05.889
let's go ahead and run this command
import math

0:06:05.889,0:06:07.849
they think it was

0:06:07.849,0:06:11.169
actually is bringing in in module of

0:06:11.169,0:06:13.020
utilities we can use

0:06:13.020,0:06:13.950
and uh...

0:06:13.950,0:06:16.700
modules are places that people put
together

0:06:16.700,0:06:18.130
whole set of tools that

0:06:18.130,0:06:20.289
that kind of function as a group

0:06:20.289,0:06:22.190
can help you out

0:06:22.190,0:06:23.620
and we can use

0:06:23.620,0:06:26.759
muskie's a bunch of math functions that
are currently available you can bring

0:06:26.759,0:06:29.430
them in asking import

0:06:29.430,0:06:31.749
inside there we can see matt top-line

0:06:31.749,0:06:36.449
when the number pies are defined for us
with some pretty good person

0:06:36.449,0:06:40.849
we can take this time something stands a
line

0:06:40.849,0:06:44.330
master hi-def

0:06:44.330,0:06:45.689
to you

0:06:45.689,0:06:49.019
and kim one point no

0:06:49.019,0:06:50.360

0:06:50.360,0:06:51.360
convert

0:06:51.360,0:06:55.210
degrees to reinstate the sea three sixty

0:06:55.210,0:06:58.150
it's going to miss back coupon

0:06:58.150,0:07:01.830
and we could see math dot degrees

0:07:01.830,0:07:07.939
hand and a few times

0:07:07.939,0:07:12.620
many kids at three sixteen

0:07:12.620,0:07:14.299
with the module

0:07:14.299,0:07:18.050
who knows what's in that we could go
google it but that wouldn't be any fun

0:07:18.050,0:07:21.529
it's actually possible from the upright
on shell too tight

0:07:21.529,0:07:22.750
math dot

0:07:22.750,0:07:24.839
and then pressed topper completion and

0:07:24.839,0:07:28.809
will grow up and try to find this
everything that is in that module

0:07:28.809,0:07:32.579
for now please ignore anything with the
underscores all these guys in the

0:07:32.579,0:07:34.210
beginning

0:07:34.210,0:07:35.849
just ignore those

0:07:35.849,0:07:37.389
have died

0:07:37.389,0:07:39.110
continue here

0:07:39.110,0:07:46.110
that p

0:07:46.649,0:07:50.749
let's take a look at something called
bliss

0:07:50.749,0:07:52.300
and we can't wait

0:07:52.300,0:07:53.429
range

0:07:53.429,0:07:56.159
four and the range command is going to
give us

0:07:56.159,0:07:57.659
uh... list of items

0:07:57.659,0:08:03.210
time from zero up to one last and that
we get so give us four items

0:08:03.210,0:08:04.790
we can save range

0:08:04.790,0:08:05.759
uh...

0:08:05.759,0:08:09.849
three three two seven instead to give us
is serving at the number three up to

0:08:09.849,0:08:11.909
date not including seven

0:08:11.909,0:08:13.919
figures can you give us

0:08:13.919,0:08:16.729
three four five six

0:08:16.729,0:08:20.379
and uh... we can also see range

0:08:20.379,0:08:22.229
three com au twenty eight

0:08:22.229,0:08:24.479
and in their we can

0:08:24.479,0:08:26.220
uh...

0:08:26.220,0:08:28.719
and so it's going to be as every fifty
one pt

0:08:28.719,0:08:34.050
considerate three each thirteen eighteen
and twenty three

0:08:34.050,0:08:35.930
now we can make our months

0:08:35.930,0:08:39.440
because they ship sequels

0:08:39.440,0:08:40.830
instead

0:08:40.830,0:08:43.260
togher stirring

0:08:46.490,0:08:48.730
ignore the less they don't have to be

0:08:48.730,0:08:50.500
soon

0:08:50.500,0:08:55.460
uh... at things we can have a with the
contains numbers and strings other types

0:08:55.460,0:08:58.680
of objects

0:08:58.680,0:09:03.600
so here are making are just a list of
the couple shipp's japan fires

0:09:03.600,0:09:08.130
and we can see a tight ships in aspect
on what i think this place

0:09:08.130,0:09:10.470
returns the worst too surprising

0:09:10.470,0:09:13.560
now we can also and things onto a list

0:09:13.560,0:09:16.030
efficient stuff and

0:09:16.030,0:09:20.390
and then we can pass it whatever we feel
like that you're going to have another

0:09:20.390,0:09:26.560
interesting ship the status of the
university of new hampshire ship

0:09:26.560,0:09:28.280
and now protectionists

0:09:28.280,0:09:30.690
they'll be something else in the kitchen

0:09:30.690,0:09:31.830
ships now

0:09:31.830,0:09:35.900
and we create one starting up with for
items that appear and you know

0:09:35.900,0:09:38.020
five items downs

0:09:38.020,0:09:40.180
thank god

0:09:40.180,0:09:41.750
now we can also

0:09:41.750,0:09:44.650
looking to west imagines

0:09:44.650,0:09:48.750
position zero so we count from zero here
so tied

0:09:48.750,0:09:50.340
and we can say shipp's

0:09:50.340,0:09:52.200
minus one

0:09:52.200,0:09:54.440
and others are last item

0:09:54.440,0:09:56.350
ships plans to b

0:09:56.350,0:09:59.980
the second to last item acceptor

0:09:59.980,0:10:01.420
now we can also

0:10:01.420,0:10:02.420
stations

0:10:02.420,0:10:03.630
remove

0:10:03.630,0:10:07.730
and we can get rid of any one of those
items muscular remotely comparable to

0:10:07.730,0:10:08.950
very useful

0:10:08.950,0:10:12.630
an appetite ships there's no more remote

0:10:12.630,0:10:13.819
now if we want this

0:10:13.819,0:10:16.870
tax should be sorted we can just say
such ships dot

0:10:16.870,0:10:19.260
storage

0:10:19.260,0:10:21.490
and call this matter

0:10:21.490,0:10:25.770
now pend and sort harbor called matters
they're kind of like functions that go

0:10:25.770,0:10:27.860
on a object

0:10:27.860,0:10:32.430
the attached to it and we worked with
that project

0:10:32.430,0:10:34.070
synoptic type ships

0:10:34.070,0:10:37.930
it's actually been restored and numbers
come before letters

0:10:37.930,0:10:39.770
so will have now are sorted

0:10:39.770,0:10:44.650
list of ships with their i_d_ numbers in
them

0:10:44.650,0:10:47.290
manufacture expressed time

0:10:47.290,0:10:50.790
and this project has a bunch of things
ignore all of the things with

0:10:50.790,0:10:51.890
underscores

0:10:51.890,0:10:56.960
can just look at the plus column with
handicapped extended index and search

0:10:56.960,0:11:02.650
i number fixing things we can see ships
dock verse

0:11:02.650,0:11:04.790
and shifts again

0:11:04.790,0:11:11.790
and now the ships is everywhere prints
were placed

0:11:12.540,0:11:17.240
so let's have some fun with our ship
name appreciate name and look at what we

0:11:17.240,0:11:19.560
can do with some string operations

0:11:19.560,0:11:21.880
so we'll see

0:11:21.880,0:11:28.300
challenger com research vessel lofton

0:11:28.300,0:11:30.130
and so that we have a ship name

0:11:30.130,0:11:33.890
began to start working with that
invitation name dot split

0:11:33.890,0:11:36.200
and split operation break things up

0:11:36.200,0:11:42.000
into johnson generates a list based on
something that's traditionally ministry

0:11:42.000,0:11:42.640
default

0:11:42.640,0:11:46.560
behaviors are split on any white space
so it's gonna split here on the space

0:11:46.560,0:11:48.020
and then here

0:11:48.020,0:11:51.350
on the space between the calm and party

0:11:51.350,0:11:56.290
would also ask at the split on anything
that we want so we can split on

0:11:56.290,0:11:57.880
commons

0:11:57.880,0:12:00.620
and then it will split ac golf
challenger

0:12:00.620,0:12:03.529
and then this will be harvey netspace

0:12:03.529,0:12:06.300
suzanne pete

0:12:06.300,0:12:10.770
so now we can actually see this and
variables we can say fields equals ship

0:12:10.770,0:12:13.180
name s

0:12:13.180,0:12:15.720
hand

0:12:15.720,0:12:17.850
split

0:12:17.850,0:12:20.690
and you can see fields clinton fields

0:12:20.690,0:12:23.800
we have golf challenger v

0:12:23.800,0:12:27.089
now the name of our ship this in the
first part of conceiving equals

0:12:27.089,0:12:31.460
yields these current account

0:12:31.460,0:12:33.620
zero

0:12:33.620,0:12:36.840
mean we have gulf challenger

0:12:36.840,0:12:40.430
and there's fighting as you can do a
string speak and repeated strings will

0:12:40.430,0:12:43.750
plant singing times

0:12:43.750,0:12:45.060
times for

0:12:45.060,0:12:48.570
and we'll have to chapters which times

0:12:48.570,0:12:50.240
probably not we wanted

0:12:50.240,0:12:53.490
but we can also join teams together with
any string he wants to be keen to join

0:12:53.490,0:12:55.840
this maybe two dash is

0:12:55.840,0:12:57.050
joining

0:12:57.050,0:13:01.930
and they pass at the list of things we
want to join together to concede fields

0:13:01.930,0:13:06.520
miserable being separated by comma
wilson separate science-based actions of

0:13:06.520,0:13:08.550
the space

0:13:08.550,0:13:10.649
today article challenger

0:13:10.649,0:13:13.540
destroyed

0:13:13.540,0:13:16.710
to give you an example to fields dot

0:13:16.710,0:13:19.010
and

0:13:19.010,0:13:21.060
stick on something

0:13:21.060,0:13:23.100
palce

0:13:23.100,0:13:27.660
the pretty fields or feels lists and we
can and join

0:13:27.660,0:13:28.780
fields

0:13:28.780,0:13:30.490
handbook that we have

0:13:30.490,0:13:32.029
accident

0:13:32.029,0:13:36.870
so it's nice to be able to come up with

0:13:36.870,0:13:41.450
let's take a quick look at working with
some files minute open up imax here in a

0:13:41.450,0:13:44.680
minute creating a final

0:13:44.680,0:13:48.630
make this point to smaller for a second
statement

0:13:48.630,0:13:50.870
you know

0:13:50.870,0:13:54.010
expert relax control after open a file

0:13:54.010,0:13:56.100
and we're going to say

0:13:56.100,0:14:00.890
recall that data dot csd for
comma-separated value can be taken to

0:14:00.890,0:14:02.960
members on

0:14:02.960,0:14:04.450
one comment to you

0:14:04.450,0:14:06.210
for compliance

0:14:06.210,0:14:09.350
and nine minus one

0:14:09.350,0:14:11.740
let's say that with control acts

0:14:11.740,0:14:14.140
control s person

0:14:14.140,0:14:15.340
now is saved

0:14:15.340,0:14:18.140
yeah let's go back to work from home

0:14:18.140,0:14:22.140
yuppie debbie d_n_c_ that were in
research tools we can do and how us

0:14:22.140,0:14:25.510
and we can see that we actually happened
right now

0:14:25.510,0:14:27.520
needed csd

0:14:27.520,0:14:29.250
so we can do any left

0:14:29.250,0:14:31.370
david csd

0:14:31.370,0:14:33.980
and their data

0:14:33.980,0:14:38.060
degeneres too fast so they're giardia

0:14:38.060,0:14:39.890
can't we can now go ahead

0:14:39.890,0:14:42.120
and try to work with that file

0:14:42.120,0:14:46.790
files are fairly kisi impact on visited
a final which is gonna be a variable

0:14:46.790,0:14:48.250
will be final

0:14:48.250,0:14:49.650
open

0:14:49.650,0:14:52.340
the csd

0:14:52.340,0:14:53.110
inter

0:14:53.110,0:14:55.390
and now face a tight

0:14:55.390,0:14:56.680
if i

0:14:56.680,0:14:57.950
presenter

0:14:57.950,0:15:00.130
we have something file

0:15:00.130,0:15:05.130
so careful and have a false hope we can
do with the final affair

0:15:05.130,0:15:07.990
pretty large i think you could file

0:15:07.990,0:15:12.850
when we return up with first red-lining
right there

0:15:12.850,0:15:16.160
so student filed red-line

0:15:16.160,0:15:22.140
and presenter

0:15:22.140,0:15:23.660
everything

0:15:23.660,0:15:25.910
re

0:15:25.910,0:15:28.310
to return to us the very first one

0:15:28.310,0:15:32.240
but disfigured character at the end here
slash and has a new one that came with

0:15:32.240,0:15:33.020
it

0:15:33.020,0:15:35.660
so if you want to get rid of that
there's a command called strip you can

0:15:35.660,0:15:38.500
call gonna anything

0:15:38.500,0:15:42.160
and that strips off any white spaces
with something

0:15:42.160,0:15:45.530
but this is something we're tied chained
together

0:15:45.530,0:15:50.090
his first thing that i did in which
returned what came out of that

0:15:50.090,0:15:52.130
experts perhaps the next morning

0:15:52.130,0:15:52.929
and

0:15:52.929,0:15:54.670
and i passed it to extract

0:15:54.670,0:15:56.410
wished and strips

0:15:56.410,0:15:59.260
white-space subgroup things together

0:15:59.260,0:16:01.940
had built up something that surprising

0:16:01.940,0:16:03.730
let's read some more lines

0:16:03.730,0:16:06.480
so there's that they were going to do it
again

0:16:06.480,0:16:11.360
well past the end of our day and week at
that point clinton again pipelines

0:16:11.360,0:16:13.110
for after

0:16:13.110,0:16:17.310
let's go ahead and delete that terrible
anymore

0:16:17.310,0:16:19.170
datafile

0:16:19.170,0:16:22.410
guys no more certainly is a nice
functions you just get something out of

0:16:22.410,0:16:24.410
your workspace

0:16:24.410,0:16:27.560
both reopened datafile

0:16:27.560,0:16:29.950
datafile schools

0:16:29.950,0:16:31.620
opened

0:16:31.620,0:16:35.420
uh... csd

0:16:35.420,0:16:36.559
it's opened

0:16:36.559,0:16:40.210
now there was another function there
should be to get a final time

0:16:40.210,0:16:41.820
and there's

0:16:41.820,0:16:44.480
something called red-lined

0:16:44.480,0:16:46.210
red-line scanned

0:16:46.210,0:16:48.480
ashu pulled the whole filing at once

0:16:48.480,0:16:51.670
schools read lines perot

0:16:51.670,0:16:56.570
and will say data

0:16:56.570,0:16:59.310
lines equals

0:16:59.310,0:17:00.280
wants

0:17:00.280,0:17:02.400
wants to have gone here type

0:17:02.400,0:17:04.000
lines

0:17:04.000,0:17:06.740
and i just add something funny that i
happen to you

0:17:06.740,0:17:08.339
habit

0:17:08.339,0:17:11.230
if you leave out the print to see the
light i thought it would put them in for

0:17:11.230,0:17:11.920
you

0:17:11.920,0:17:16.720
and try to create women actually works
for python tahir of the practices for us

0:17:16.720,0:17:20.209
and ran a rich man so when i really
should take place

0:17:20.209,0:17:22.740
destroyed currencies

0:17:22.740,0:17:25.690
and returned to us that we have a list

0:17:25.690,0:17:28.920
because they want west and hopefully
persons

0:17:28.920,0:17:33.200
thoroughly

0:17:33.200,0:17:36.360
lines teeth my hairs

0:17:36.360,0:17:38.490
and we have three wanted to hear

0:17:38.490,0:17:43.289
then we can take a look at long hotlines
two lines firstline

0:17:43.289,0:17:44.429
and that

0:17:44.429,0:17:47.800
looks just like that we expect to have
that new one on the weekend

0:17:47.800,0:17:49.480
so damn cute lines

0:17:49.480,0:17:50.730
many and

0:17:50.730,0:17:52.370
strip that remove that

0:17:52.370,0:17:53.929
speak softly and

0:17:53.929,0:18:00.690
and then we can go back to use that
split

0:18:00.690,0:18:03.309
amra spot on the common we should get
back

0:18:03.309,0:18:09.150
the numbers one and two analyst

0:18:09.150,0:18:10.130
so it's

0:18:10.130,0:18:10.890
take that

0:18:10.890,0:18:12.370
and we can then

0:18:12.370,0:18:13.970
stay

0:18:13.970,0:18:14.929
him

0:18:14.929,0:18:19.159
fields

0:18:19.159,0:18:20.700
equals

0:18:20.700,0:18:21.850
and

0:18:21.850,0:18:23.970
feels now contains list

0:18:23.970,0:18:26.110
mckenzie fields era

0:18:26.110,0:18:32.010
fields

0:18:32.010,0:18:34.040
now let's take a quick look at

0:18:34.040,0:18:37.830
doing eight for loop before we go any
farther

0:18:37.830,0:18:39.020
so we're gonna build up

0:18:39.020,0:18:40.050
uh...

0:18:40.050,0:18:41.070
for loop

0:18:41.070,0:18:42.880
and you can see four

0:18:42.880,0:18:47.309
and then you say you're very bold so
number

0:18:47.309,0:18:51.080
committees that range coming in to
assist you range for

0:18:51.080,0:18:52.140
and so it's going to

0:18:52.140,0:18:54.760
returns a list of sport things here

0:18:54.760,0:18:58.510
and then we can hear across those
horribly through any time

0:18:58.510,0:19:03.040
the output of range the next couple of
wanted number

0:19:03.040,0:19:04.170
here

0:19:04.170,0:19:08.270
these dots on the laughter telling us a
treaty more input

0:19:08.270,0:19:12.409
to create blocks in python actually uses
indentation

0:19:12.409,0:19:15.330
so we're going to be very careful about
our spaces

0:19:15.330,0:19:18.760
and we're going to have more in the next
video but if you pay attention to were

0:19:18.760,0:19:22.039
reduced prices determined

0:19:22.039,0:19:25.100
still save print

0:19:25.100,0:19:26.480
presenter

0:19:26.480,0:19:30.110
now its wings and a block away from the
lock at his press enter again in the

0:19:30.110,0:19:31.980
pipeline

0:19:31.980,0:19:32.900
is done

0:19:32.900,0:19:35.350
it's gonna print zero one two three

0:19:35.350,0:19:38.169
so from monroe range

0:19:38.169,0:19:40.930
returns astronomers

0:19:40.930,0:19:44.070
let's try something a little more
painting before

0:19:44.070,0:19:46.410
item and

0:19:46.410,0:19:50.059
sister book to be what everyone seems
conchal item

0:19:50.059,0:19:52.310
and it is a warning

0:19:52.310,0:19:53.799
to five

0:19:53.799,0:19:57.350
for

0:19:57.350,0:19:59.230
four

0:19:59.230,0:20:03.150
a little

0:20:03.150,0:20:07.090
cohen says is the end of the forum http
www presenter more intensity helping us

0:20:07.090,0:20:08.060
out

0:20:08.060,0:20:12.120
and then we can save print

0:20:12.120,0:20:14.180
so there is dakar list

0:20:14.180,0:20:20.970
coming out and work that they're and it
can be whatever and west

0:20:20.970,0:20:24.540
so let's do something with our data we
can actually open up our final and

0:20:24.540,0:20:26.279
looked over all the lines

0:20:26.279,0:20:28.500
so that's it for lying in

0:20:28.500,0:20:29.770
open

0:20:29.770,0:20:32.170
deducts yes v

0:20:32.170,0:20:37.220
it's opening up files were removed one
line timing right

0:20:37.220,0:20:39.040
and

0:20:39.040,0:20:40.640
western springs

0:20:40.640,0:20:44.090
uh...

0:20:44.090,0:20:46.029
enter

0:20:46.029,0:20:49.650
and we get the nuance in there so print
wants to give this a new on him too

0:20:49.650,0:20:53.030
stringent incidents wound up with a
double

0:20:53.030,0:20:55.880
blank line in there

0:20:55.880,0:20:57.120
so it's change that

0:20:57.120,0:20:58.460
distributor

0:20:58.460,0:21:03.549
normal saline darts

0:21:03.549,0:21:06.559
america looks like coming out of her
final

0:21:06.559,0:21:10.549
let's go ahead of ourselves a little bit
of code that can

0:21:10.549,0:21:12.809
trail west of all the data

0:21:12.809,0:21:16.640
and up so that we could maybe do
something with a plotting

0:21:16.640,0:21:18.650
state data equals

0:21:18.650,0:21:20.490
florida and creating here

0:21:20.490,0:21:25.710
is an anti list

0:21:25.710,0:21:28.920
citizens usb kinky everytime i go
through the fall of the new line of the

0:21:28.920,0:21:31.330
compound ardent list

0:21:31.330,0:21:34.350
let's go ahead and give it a try we can
say for

0:21:34.350,0:21:37.640
line hand open

0:21:37.640,0:21:38.890
it

0:21:38.890,0:21:41.350
csd

0:21:41.350,0:21:44.090
and then we can do with instead

0:21:44.090,0:21:47.550
outdated dot and

0:21:47.550,0:21:53.100
wind stroller

0:21:53.100,0:21:55.200

0:21:55.200,0:21:57.490
and i want to data

0:21:57.490,0:22:01.390
india now contains the string for each

0:22:10.530,0:22:12.270
analysts say four

0:22:12.270,0:22:15.250

0:22:15.250,0:22:16.880
you'd

0:22:16.880,0:22:18.190
we've got that

0:22:18.190,0:22:20.730
will go ahead and see if we can

0:22:20.730,0:22:23.580
split them apart he gives me a little
more useful rights we actually have

0:22:23.580,0:22:24.750
numbers west

0:22:24.750,0:22:25.799
it's a

0:22:25.799,0:22:29.160
fields equals longing

0:22:29.160,0:22:31.470
works

0:22:31.470,0:22:33.400
well my comment

0:22:33.400,0:22:36.390
since we have common unfair

0:22:36.390,0:22:40.930
and now we have this in fields we how r
or first field is our accident second

0:22:40.930,0:22:44.250
winds will see those variables x equals

0:22:44.250,0:22:47.610
and you can actually ask you to try and
make you number

0:22:47.610,0:22:50.880
uh... strings will say this is a singer

0:22:50.880,0:22:53.679
yields

0:22:53.679,0:22:56.559
cirrhosis of the first few months

0:22:56.559,0:22:59.980
and we can say boy equal citizens

0:22:59.980,0:23:03.919
fields one

0:23:03.919,0:23:10.919
so we have our x and y and would like to
append insurer religious append

again

0:23:22.380,0:23:25.750
wartime analysis princeton issue dot

0:23:25.750,0:23:28.570
so now we actually have a list
containing lists in science and as a

0:23:28.570,0:23:29.919
list here

0:23:29.919,0:23:32.330
was here for each of our lines

0:23:32.330,0:23:33.860
and so we can say

0:23:33.860,0:23:36.340
data

0:23:36.340,0:23:38.919
dataset zero date back down

0:23:38.919,0:23:40.090

0:23:42.390,0:23:44.520
yes curator point or

0:23:44.520,0:23:49.710
i swore as possible

0:23:49.710,0:23:53.660
create we can look at it that way we can
manipulate it once we have been

0:23:53.660,0:23:56.560
let's put data and other way hand

0:23:56.560,0:23:59.080
communities have gone through lectures

0:23:59.080,0:24:02.490
we can import module called number high
yesterday

0:24:02.490,0:24:03.870
very fancy

0:24:03.870,0:24:05.690
array promising to lopez

0:24:05.690,0:24:10.230
very fast and very well designed for
doing scientific depressing

0:24:10.230,0:24:11.730
sweetie company

0:24:11.730,0:24:13.790
if we take num pie

0:24:13.790,0:24:17.780
documents how we're gonna get over
loaded with options

0:24:17.780,0:24:19.100
and there's a time

0:24:19.100,0:24:20.940
and stuff in here

0:24:20.940,0:24:23.679
but we actually i'm gonna tell you the
one we want because

0:24:23.679,0:24:27.780
the get overwhelmed fine to load t x t

0:24:27.780,0:24:28.429
here

0:24:28.429,0:24:29.960
functioned taxed

0:24:29.960,0:24:34.980
and i i thought we can put a question
mark after

0:24:34.980,0:24:39.270
auditory thing of any kind in the
contract ask for help on its own that in

0:24:39.270,0:24:40.750
their press printer

0:24:40.750,0:24:43.230
determined to get the help for

0:24:43.230,0:24:44.980
the low-tech function

0:24:44.980,0:24:49.360
here told me it's a function bunch of
stuff that you shouldn't care about

0:24:49.360,0:24:50.190
but here

0:24:50.190,0:24:54.149
is hallway options we can pass to it
sweet prasanna

0:24:54.149,0:24:56.399
abstain which means file name

0:24:56.399,0:24:59.380
uh... too tight for nurses singers

0:24:59.380,0:25:02.740
and delimiter we have a comma delimited
file

0:25:02.740,0:25:06.210
and we uh... details

0:25:06.210,0:25:10.720
sold it to you to come back and read a
whole documentation if you want more

0:25:10.720,0:25:11.730
let's give it a try

0:25:11.730,0:25:14.650
number tied up with t_n_t_

0:25:14.650,0:25:18.500
and file names data

0:25:18.500,0:25:21.390
s yes

0:25:21.390,0:25:24.800
parton try to complete and

0:25:24.800,0:25:27.920
and then we're going to give it d type

0:25:27.920,0:25:28.519
equals

0:25:28.519,0:25:29.990
hint

0:25:29.990,0:25:31.850
and

0:25:31.850,0:25:35.990
delimiter

0:25:35.990,0:25:39.670
equals

0:25:39.670,0:25:42.350
konzi schools

0:25:42.350,0:25:47.970
so let's take a look cap watergate
actually as we'll see tight

0:25:47.970,0:25:51.200
we get back is the number high and delay

0:25:51.200,0:25:53.740
don't worry too much about what that
means

0:25:53.740,0:25:56.250
wanted to know more proud yet

0:25:56.250,0:25:57.240
the series

0:25:57.240,0:26:00.320
but for now just know there is a list
data points

0:26:00.320,0:26:01.970
too if you take tina

0:26:01.970,0:26:03.120
there we can see

0:26:03.120,0:26:04.330
we have an array

0:26:04.330,0:26:07.540
which is a little different than west
but it works pretty much the same

0:26:07.540,0:26:10.100
these things are fairly changeable

0:26:10.100,0:26:12.530
if we can try to ask for list

0:26:12.530,0:26:14.019
gardena

0:26:14.019,0:26:15.429
and you'll get back to it

0:26:15.429,0:26:19.040
they'll take easy pieces apart unit
overall listings and i will be a bunch

0:26:19.040,0:26:20.330
of little race

0:26:20.330,0:26:21.840
cdr

0:26:21.840,0:26:23.450
sub-zero

0:26:23.450,0:26:26.679
hand that looks very much like this
first by themselves

0:26:26.679,0:26:29.480
and a raise an array of raised

0:26:29.480,0:26:34.720
you'll get used to this over time

0:26:34.720,0:26:38.920
we know i've heard a word in which is
very nice movie too

0:26:38.920,0:26:43.940
you got with all sorts of textiles and
later read binary data

0:26:43.940,0:26:45.530
have impact

0:26:45.530,0:26:46.940
uh... stuff coming out of

0:26:46.940,0:26:48.920
various instruments

0:26:48.920,0:26:52.470
now let's go ahead and so quick to peak
act

0:26:52.470,0:26:53.580

who want to wait to be able to patch up
and put together

0:27:08.870,0:27:11.570
series instructions that you'd like to
have

0:27:11.570,0:27:16.280
as anything that you can they keep
calling damage and to do the same past

0:27:16.280,0:27:18.100
it's called

0:27:18.100,0:27:21.960
post creole function you get with the
keyword death

0:27:21.960,0:27:23.340
for defined

0:27:23.340,0:27:28.500
and recruit functional hands once you
number

0:27:28.500,0:27:31.930
you can break things apart and vitality
underscore and functioning so you can't

0:27:31.930,0:27:33.480
use the dash

0:27:33.480,0:27:36.320
but you can use an underscore so we're
going to give a number

0:27:36.320,0:27:40.440
and this is the argument in this and
number two four passing in

0:27:40.440,0:27:43.840
and just looking for a loop to break it
worked out

0:27:43.840,0:27:45.500
didn't want to call one

0:27:45.500,0:27:48.380
coming up through intends to start
function

0:27:48.380,0:27:50.190
because they knew

0:27:50.190,0:27:52.970
number equals number

0:27:52.970,0:27:56.050
ones were an unwanted number receiving
it

0:27:56.050,0:28:02.000
and then we're done you return it back
has the answer

0:28:02.000,0:28:06.380
present whites here and now we have a
fortune content-type

0:28:06.380,0:28:08.760
head

0:28:08.760,0:28:10.799
and it is a function

0:28:10.799,0:28:13.360
now let's give it a call breaking down

0:28:13.360,0:28:14.269
try it out

0:28:14.269,0:28:18.120
nancy pad

0:28:18.120,0:28:22.470
and weekend and say

0:28:22.470,0:28:24.670
and get back

0:28:24.670,0:28:28.600
so that's the basics of type on an early
beginning level

0:28:28.600,0:28:32.240
hope will give you a sense of some a
little pieces that will be using and

0:28:32.240,0:28:35.850
we're going to be quickly adding on to
this and doing some fun plotting in

0:28:35.850,0:28:37.600
crafting

0:28:37.600,0:28:39.520
