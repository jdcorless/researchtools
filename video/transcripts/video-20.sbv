0:00:01.599,0:00:06.360
hello and welcome to research tools of
video twenty secure shell versus h my

0:00:06.360,0:00:07.890
name is kurt shwarier

0:00:07.890,0:00:13.110
and z video for the u_n_ hcr difficult
solution abington high graphics center

0:00:13.110,0:00:17.130
and this is a classes actually being
done after uh... the research tools

0:00:17.130,0:00:18.619
classes finished

0:00:18.619,0:00:21.909
but there are many more topics yet to be
covered that i wasn't able to make it to

0:00:21.909,0:00:23.349
you within the class

0:00:23.349,0:00:27.519
so they contain decreed videos as best
they can to fill out more topics that

0:00:27.519,0:00:30.989
will help you out in your research

0:00:30.989,0:00:34.670
since they were talked about how to
connect two computers securely in a way

0:00:34.670,0:00:38.160
that you don't give up your password in
the clear across the network because of

0:00:38.160,0:00:38.559
it

0:00:38.559,0:00:41.090
if you things like telnet an escapee

0:00:41.090,0:00:44.920
your password can actually get side by
the bad guys and it will get side of

0:00:44.920,0:00:46.910
actually

0:00:46.910,0:00:50.480
in that case they may be able to do bad
things to your computers in houston for

0:00:50.480,0:00:52.790
things you would rather they didn't

0:00:52.790,0:00:56.480
with a to avoid as much as possible so i
can remember not to run things like

0:00:56.480,0:01:01.340
telnet nasty pianist you understand what
you're doing and why it's okay

0:01:01.340,0:01:04.730
if for some reason you end up having to
use them for some reason

0:01:04.730,0:01:05.940
that

0:01:05.940,0:01:09.880
uh... but your password possibly get out
there to suggest you quickly going to

0:01:09.880,0:01:12.650
japan for its recent secure means

0:01:12.650,0:01:14.720
let's go ahead and get started

0:01:14.720,0:01:17.410
and the first thing is that the stuff
over showing today

0:01:17.410,0:01:21.790
is also available for those on mac and
windows in the fury

0:01:21.790,0:01:23.750
windows user

0:01:23.750,0:01:27.250
microsoft windows you can use tools from
cygwin

0:01:27.250,0:01:30.940
that will install a limits for unix like
environment on

0:01:30.940,0:01:33.079
your windows computer

0:01:33.079,0:01:36.590
you'll then be able to run a cessation
terminal window and

0:01:36.590,0:01:40.939
will look at command called crown that
will actually run commands periodically

0:01:40.939,0:01:44.119
for you in the background

0:01:44.119,0:01:46.490
okay since this started

0:01:46.490,0:01:50.690
cammarata terminal now this is a yugo
into let's first machines eleven point

0:01:50.690,0:01:52.080
zero four

0:01:52.080,0:01:55.260
so that was the police in two thousand
eleven in april

0:01:55.260,0:01:57.420
in this machine is on my laptop

0:01:57.420,0:02:02.140
annemarie working with p remote clinics
machine that's a virtual machine at citi

0:02:02.140,0:02:02.979
com

0:02:02.979,0:02:05.930
on network that unless your etsy com you
won't be able to

0:02:05.930,0:02:06.980
two-seat

0:02:06.980,0:02:10.429
so if you're working with this class in
united com

0:02:10.429,0:02:13.360
you'll have to find some other virtual
machine to connect to you

0:02:13.360,0:02:14.879
try out these things

0:02:14.879,0:02:19.409
it works with uh... any mixer mac
machine set to receive for milk actions

0:02:19.409,0:02:23.449
procurement straighter if you need
figure out how to do that

0:02:23.449,0:02:27.519
so will go ahead and janae keep going on
that

0:02:27.519,0:02:31.559
persecution of will demand ask a witches
have propelled

0:02:31.559,0:02:35.229
and has to say ecstasy what's available
on

0:02:35.229,0:02:39.900
machine terms of manual pages seed that
you could arty f_m_

0:02:39.900,0:02:43.680
and we have been a cessation page has
the for the main program will also be

0:02:43.680,0:02:45.099
looking at

0:02:45.099,0:02:48.040
and a half password but that's a stage
keygen

0:02:48.040,0:02:51.079
which'll generator cryptographic keys
that we used to you

0:02:51.079,0:02:53.899
took action without having to pay for a
password

0:02:53.899,0:02:55.580
and then will also be

0:02:55.580,0:02:58.659
using a command called icp or secure
copy

0:02:58.659,0:03:01.579
let's take a look at man at a stage

0:03:01.579,0:03:04.829
and uh... the secure shell which is
actually open a cessation is what's on

0:03:04.829,0:03:07.449
most computers today

0:03:07.449,0:03:10.729
can be pretty simple but it can also be
quite complicated and you could be some

0:03:10.729,0:03:14.279
very fancy things that we won't miss lee
tried today

0:03:14.279,0:03:17.929
encourage you to learn a lot more
because s_s_-eighteen really improve

0:03:17.929,0:03:20.219
what you're capable of doing with data

0:03:20.219,0:03:24.089
damaging computers around the globe

0:03:24.089,0:03:27.769
okay says let's take a look at our
machine here so if we do know us dash

0:03:27.769,0:03:30.979
l_a_ dullest all files including hidden
ones

0:03:30.979,0:03:32.919
and we say correct for

0:03:32.919,0:03:37.109
process h to see if there's anything
related deaths each in our home retreat

0:03:37.109,0:03:41.039
there's not there's just this last file
that became north

0:03:41.039,0:03:41.810
int

0:03:41.810,0:03:42.949
uh...

0:03:42.949,0:03:45.829
once we get going we're going to have a
dog has to say star three it's gonna

0:03:45.829,0:03:48.159
start building up information

0:03:48.159,0:03:51.789
so it's type hosting this year we are
right now sore on you go into virtual

0:03:51.789,0:03:53.129
machine

0:03:53.129,0:03:57.579
and we're going to ask the sage more
secure shell into the research tools

0:03:57.579,0:03:59.749
computers he calms as the stage

0:03:59.749,0:04:01.189
research

0:04:01.189,0:04:06.430
tools dot secom dot ten h members
antique home dot pages only for those

0:04:06.430,0:04:09.089
people inside ccom

0:04:09.089,0:04:11.009
if i pressed enter

0:04:11.009,0:04:15.119
came here starts seeing some interesting
information about

0:04:15.119,0:04:18.049
secure shell as we get going here

0:04:18.049,0:04:21.509
i'm going to get control c and try again
so that you can actually see what it

0:04:21.509,0:04:22.970
says

0:04:22.970,0:04:25.530
so we did our asa stage right here

0:04:25.530,0:04:27.990
and have been assets this question

0:04:27.990,0:04:30.750
what's going on is that secure shell
actually

0:04:30.750,0:04:34.500
talks to the computer and get psyche for
it

0:04:34.500,0:04:36.469
bhakti is

0:04:36.469,0:04:39.909
how cryptographic identifier for that
computers that key changes you're

0:04:39.909,0:04:43.709
probably talking to a different computer
or somebody screwed up the update to the

0:04:43.709,0:04:44.439
machine

0:04:44.439,0:04:47.289
and you might not want to trust that
computer will see that more in a little

0:04:47.289,0:04:49.710
bit

0:04:49.710,0:04:54.669
so that we can type yes to say this is a
new machine or willing to trust yes

0:04:54.669,0:04:57.720
and now it says that that's been
permalink added

0:04:57.720,0:04:59.949
tillis of known homes

0:04:59.949,0:05:02.930
and then this message right here
something we're gonna see a fair bit

0:05:02.930,0:05:04.230
from ccom

0:05:04.230,0:05:08.030
it's a requirement of the government's
insist computer has

0:05:08.030,0:05:10.509
government funding is that a state
university

0:05:10.509,0:05:15.220
it has to have warnings about that you
have no right to privacy except center

0:05:15.220,0:05:20.270
so go ahead and take that my password
for this account

0:05:20.270,0:05:21.989
and press enter

0:05:21.989,0:05:25.850
and i'm now log interrupt computer and
it's got

0:05:25.850,0:05:29.830
as it logs in its tongue a little bit
about itself

0:05:29.830,0:05:34.689
itself so you go into eleven oh four
computer and scenery dot here

0:05:34.689,0:05:36.800
amplitype hostname

0:05:36.800,0:05:40.430
will see that this computers called
research tools

0:05:40.430,0:05:43.489
so we're now in a remote computer

0:05:43.489,0:05:46.169
there's no one else for them

0:05:46.169,0:05:52.440
pickup time it is his computer has been
up for ninety one days

0:05:52.440,0:05:53.910
flat screen appetite

0:05:53.910,0:05:59.720
exit were back to our original computer
hostname

0:05:59.720,0:06:04.699
further where we are back on our virtual
machine on our laptop

0:06:04.699,0:06:07.459
now could you tell us that selling

0:06:07.459,0:06:09.890
pipe that was a vertical bar to correct

0:06:09.890,0:06:12.740
the search for the string s h

0:06:12.740,0:06:17.020
nationalize case insensitive on your
crap presenter

0:06:17.020,0:06:21.699
and lo and behold we have a new
directory called dot as the sage

0:06:21.699,0:06:25.669
this treachery is super important for us
to say chickens are also important that

0:06:25.669,0:06:27.849
nobody else can read this

0:06:27.849,0:06:31.059
not typically if you're just on a laptop
by yourself this wouldn't matter too

0:06:31.059,0:06:32.419
much

0:06:32.419,0:06:35.689
but often times with a cessation you'll
be working on computers for many people

0:06:35.689,0:06:38.969
again and you don't want other people to
be able to get that you're a cessation

0:06:38.969,0:06:41.749
figuration information

0:06:41.749,0:06:45.009
so it's important that the other

0:06:45.009,0:06:46.110
and group

0:06:46.110,0:06:49.430
flags are all zeroed out can

0:06:49.430,0:06:53.179
your files christians that would be with
the c_h_ mod commands

0:06:53.179,0:06:55.949
yugos same and c_h_ mon

0:06:55.949,0:06:58.479
and that will help you change the dates
on those files

0:06:58.479,0:07:03.000
but what secure showed us the fed record
as an existing create for you

0:07:03.000,0:07:05.359
let's take a look in there

0:07:05.359,0:07:10.189
ls dash l a dot s h can we have a file
called known hosts let's take a look at

0:07:10.189,0:07:11.029
that

0:07:11.029,0:07:14.120
atlas dot that's the stage

0:07:14.120,0:07:15.520
loan hoax

0:07:15.520,0:07:19.869
and what this is is this is the keys for
each computer it that's keeping track of

0:07:19.869,0:07:22.940
down the road to compare with these
later on

0:07:22.940,0:07:24.630
not very user friendly but

0:07:24.630,0:07:25.789
at least

0:07:25.789,0:07:28.659
you have some sense of what's in there

0:07:28.659,0:07:31.079
queue to put some of what's

0:07:31.079,0:07:32.549
and we now have

0:07:32.549,0:07:36.380
uh... message directory created that we
can then put in the heart

0:07:36.380,0:07:40.110
cryptographic paired is going to be a
public key and a private key the prairie

0:07:40.110,0:07:41.379
keys for you

0:07:41.379,0:07:43.389
republic he goes elsewhere

0:07:43.389,0:07:47.679
and it gives you the ability to connect
to various places using that key rather

0:07:47.679,0:07:50.899
than any other type of authentication

0:07:50.899,0:07:57.199
and the great thing about public keys is
that the public he is only good for

0:07:57.199,0:08:00.430
for one end of the things that you have
to have both parts and you can pass

0:08:00.430,0:08:04.550
around the public key if someone gets a
hold of the reason that they have a deal

0:08:04.550,0:08:08.330
and you can see t_v_ email somebody your
public he had been installing a computer

0:08:08.330,0:08:11.710
they can then set up a connection so you
can login securely

0:08:11.710,0:08:13.569
very handy

0:08:13.569,0:08:17.590
and if treaty creek becky you can create
with or without a password

0:08:17.590,0:08:21.810
tamarin a career with the passed without
a password so that we can at this age

0:08:21.810,0:08:23.990
two

0:08:23.990,0:08:27.810
various places that i didn't have her
password every single time

0:08:27.810,0:08:31.369
that's important if it's not my job for
you might not even be

0:08:31.369,0:08:36.880
located at the computer winds coming on
so many and has a six dash keygen

0:08:36.880,0:08:39.380
and this band page isn't the most fun

0:08:39.380,0:08:42.910
because they're all the details of
creating keys i highly recommend you

0:08:42.910,0:08:43.560
read it

0:08:43.560,0:08:47.090
and hopefully ill killed out of their
kids

0:08:47.090,0:08:48.389
not very exciting

0:08:48.389,0:08:51.760
and you probably won't mission a lot of
it don't worry

0:08:51.760,0:08:54.370
will go ahead and create our first ki

0:08:54.370,0:08:57.860
pain will go ahead and say uh... stage
dash

0:08:57.860,0:09:03.090
ki

0:09:03.090,0:09:07.530
and there several types of keys there's
our essay india say keys

0:09:07.530,0:09:12.650
there's lots of detail so that will just
go the defaults to create a r_n_c_ keep

0:09:12.650,0:09:16.590
now it's going to create a file called
ideas korar saying he had seen right

0:09:16.590,0:09:17.910
here

0:09:17.910,0:09:19.890
will press answer

0:09:19.890,0:09:24.440
and we're going to have no pass phrase
so empty presenter ten feet and press

0:09:24.440,0:09:25.760
enter

0:09:25.760,0:09:29.200
it give you some more phone initiative
works

0:09:29.200,0:09:36.200
they're free to a new listing in our
s_h_ directory tel slash l dot asus h

0:09:36.270,0:09:39.540
will see that there's no q files there's
a public key

0:09:39.540,0:09:43.610
and property let's take a look at them
less

0:09:43.610,0:09:47.810
i_d_ or it's a

0:09:47.810,0:09:49.840
dot as a safe splashed

0:09:49.840,0:09:51.110
and then start

0:09:51.110,0:09:52.859
now what's gonna happen is

0:09:52.859,0:09:55.859
typically you wouldn't want to do
something like this video where people

0:09:55.859,0:09:56.870
can see your

0:09:56.870,0:09:58.320
your palate private key

0:09:58.320,0:10:02.260
now after the studios dot com anexo
hadn't just delete entire research tools

0:10:02.260,0:10:04.390
count on that server so that

0:10:04.390,0:10:06.850
somebody continues my

0:10:06.850,0:10:10.120
private so the key to get into that
computer

0:10:10.120,0:10:13.670
let's go ahead and hit enter must take a
look at these finals

0:10:13.670,0:10:18.440
and here's the prayer they key its full
of lots of data

0:10:18.440,0:10:21.140
don't worry about what's in there but
that's your private

0:10:21.140,0:10:23.310
uh... cryptographic key

0:10:23.310,0:10:26.880
very secure there's not really meant for
you to read but it is

0:10:26.880,0:10:28.850
configured such that you can

0:10:28.850,0:10:31.809
pieces around and work with it is just
pure tax

0:10:31.809,0:10:34.220
it is actually binary idea

0:10:34.220,0:10:35.650
sinecure colon

0:10:35.650,0:10:40.880
and to the next file dances are public
eats a little bit more manageable size

0:10:40.880,0:10:45.170
and it says where it was generated to
research tools that you go into

0:10:45.170,0:10:48.570
and which type of key is as a sage arce

0:10:48.570,0:10:51.420
and then send data so the pair of those
together

0:10:51.420,0:10:54.459
you can occur stuff with the public and
you can keep it

0:10:54.459,0:10:56.910
her with the private and

0:10:56.910,0:11:00.730
co-anchor an intricate with the public

0:11:00.730,0:11:05.340
so let's go ahead and we want to copy
that over to our server and put it in

0:11:05.340,0:11:07.860
something called the authorized keys so

0:11:07.860,0:11:10.270
if u_s_ cessation machine anymore

0:11:10.270,0:11:13.860
public key is in the authorized keys you
will then be able to get internet

0:11:13.860,0:11:14.940
computer

0:11:14.940,0:11:18.770
irrespective of their regular password

0:11:18.770,0:11:21.930
so we're gonna go ahead and copy that
over soviet icp

0:11:21.930,0:11:22.760
i_d_

0:11:22.760,0:11:25.090
arce hoops

0:11:25.090,0:11:29.420
dot at this age slash i_d_ arce top poem

0:11:29.420,0:11:30.690
too

0:11:30.690,0:11:33.530
research tools ta

0:11:33.530,0:11:38.150
secom dot an age colon so what this is
is a secure copy

0:11:38.150,0:11:41.340
it's the same kind of protocol is at the
stage for its

0:11:41.340,0:11:45.190
scripted connection between the two
machines instead of copy a file from our

0:11:45.190,0:11:46.390
local machine

0:11:46.390,0:11:48.650
juror mcshane machine

0:11:48.650,0:11:52.640
figures are source file that we're gonna
copy for just like the real issue pecan

0:11:52.640,0:11:53.790
and

0:11:53.790,0:11:56.850
but now we have italy specified

0:11:56.850,0:12:01.710
a computer name and that colin so this
let's use a copy file anywhere

0:12:01.710,0:12:04.820
on the internet that you'd like to copy
it do you have permission to

0:12:04.820,0:12:06.890
for breast cancer

0:12:06.890,0:12:09.250
civilians that same morning again

0:12:09.250,0:12:12.960
type in my room password

0:12:12.960,0:12:15.700
prosecutor for his great

0:12:15.700,0:12:22.700
and i didn't

0:12:23.340,0:12:30.340
and you get three trestles if i could do
it here

0:12:31.410,0:12:35.380
every girl friday third-time wrong he
wanted to take me out after the ten

0:12:35.380,0:12:36.340
million

0:12:36.340,0:12:39.060
the idea that has to prevent people from
doing

0:12:39.060,0:12:40.459
brute force password

0:12:40.459,0:12:45.700
tries as fast possible the computer
program it slows down a little bit

0:12:45.700,0:12:50.690
they still try anyway okay so now with
copper that oversold to asus age too

0:12:50.690,0:12:51.840
for research

0:12:51.840,0:12:54.630
tools dot secom dot and each

0:12:54.630,0:12:56.660
record set up a car

0:12:56.660,0:12:58.279
authorized keys

0:12:58.279,0:13:03.650
in the caucuses direct requiring are
remote computer

0:13:03.650,0:13:08.200
okay to network analysis age to research
tools and we're going to work on getting

0:13:08.200,0:13:09.090
car

0:13:09.090,0:13:11.000
public key into

0:13:11.000,0:13:17.020
our at issue to set up on the server

0:13:17.020,0:13:19.350
so large and two

0:13:19.350,0:13:20.850
the remote computer

0:13:20.850,0:13:23.150
was named as research tools

0:13:23.150,0:13:26.580
but take a look around i've got

0:13:26.580,0:13:31.850
my i_d_ underscore our say dot poem
however i don't have enough the stage

0:13:31.850,0:13:33.329
diocese directory

0:13:33.329,0:13:36.160
i can make one by just as a stage

0:13:36.160,0:13:38.400
to local host

0:13:38.400,0:13:41.050
and will type yes

0:13:41.050,0:13:45.820
hand rather than typing are password and
cutting in locally jesus is the same

0:13:45.820,0:13:47.110
machine that

0:13:47.110,0:13:48.280
iran

0:13:48.280,0:13:49.919
weight control c

0:13:49.919,0:13:51.530
come back for a prompt

0:13:51.530,0:13:56.380
and that will actually create r dot the
situation with the proper permissions

0:13:56.380,0:13:57.250
so we're going to me

0:13:57.250,0:14:01.040
uh... or i_d_ underscore our stayed up
all of them

0:14:01.040,0:14:03.250
into darkness h

0:14:03.250,0:14:07.060
but before i do that was take a look at
their us dash away

0:14:07.060,0:14:09.030
da has to say shit

0:14:09.030,0:14:12.730
and see if we just have unknown host
file she's gonna have the info for local

0:14:12.730,0:14:15.380
host

0:14:15.380,0:14:19.230
locomotion a few or at least unix
vicious refers to the computer that you

0:14:19.230,0:14:22.360
are on any one time to local host means
a different thing on every single

0:14:22.360,0:14:24.670
computer

0:14:24.670,0:14:27.570
okay so we'll do that move commands

0:14:27.570,0:14:31.090
hamburger rename it to authorized

0:14:31.090,0:14:34.790
he uses when i hope i spelled right

0:14:34.790,0:14:37.709
anti-western chile dot that's a stage

0:14:37.709,0:14:41.130
penalty we have arthritis keys in there

0:14:41.130,0:14:42.900
now if we lucked out with

0:14:42.900,0:14:44.980
exit or control d

0:14:44.980,0:14:47.080
more back to our machine

0:14:47.080,0:14:48.050
locally

0:14:48.050,0:14:50.230
hostname

0:14:50.230,0:14:54.060
sore back are you going to virtual
machine and i hope we do it has a sage

0:14:54.060,0:14:56.100
to research tools

0:14:56.100,0:14:59.550
login and it never asked my password

0:14:59.550,0:15:03.080
it didn't cryptographic signatures
saying hey look i've got the right

0:15:03.080,0:15:06.540
person who get as the right person okay
let him in

0:15:06.540,0:15:08.360
and that way you can do stuff

0:15:08.360,0:15:11.030
where you're copying files back and
forth all the time you don't have to go

0:15:11.030,0:15:14.320
crazy transmitter password everytime

0:15:14.320,0:15:18.070
now just make sure you keep that private
key secure that needs to stay as

0:15:18.070,0:15:21.600
protected as your password

0:15:21.600,0:15:24.030
and we'll go ahead int

0:15:24.030,0:15:26.730
and uh... that so we've now got

0:15:26.730,0:15:29.300
everything set up for

0:15:29.300,0:15:33.730
uh... logging-in remotely and pulling
off the ruling neat tricks of the eight

0:15:33.730,0:15:35.630
going with us this page

0:15:35.630,0:15:37.150
and s_d_p_

0:15:37.150,0:15:40.730
this way you can copy files back and
forth you can log into your heart server

0:15:40.730,0:15:43.030
and things you know faster

0:15:43.030,0:15:46.810
knows a couple config files need to know
about he may need to modified among your

0:15:46.810,0:15:48.720
local machine

0:15:48.720,0:15:53.330
or on the remote server may have to have
it mystery together for you

0:15:53.330,0:15:55.540
if the sage config

0:15:55.540,0:15:59.780
isn't slash at c slash associate
justices for the side making the

0:15:59.780,0:16:01.550
connection going out

0:16:01.550,0:16:05.290
into there shit couple things that you
may need to be changing and the key

0:16:05.290,0:16:07.400
things are typically

0:16:07.400,0:16:11.980
the forwarding of x eleven that is a
graphical user interface forwarding

0:16:11.980,0:16:16.080
so you can run commands remotely on the
real computer that require graphics that

0:16:16.080,0:16:18.750
can be displayed back on your local
machine

0:16:18.750,0:16:22.500
and this has been around since way
before things like remote desktop

0:16:22.500,0:16:26.560
where you can run programs on a trip you
want and then display them back to work

0:16:26.560,0:16:28.480
for me to go

0:16:28.480,0:16:32.330
won't go into that in the studio but
those are very keen to know about

0:16:32.330,0:16:35.020
okay so let's go ahead and try to use as
a stage

0:16:35.020,0:16:38.370
to do some need tricks

0:16:38.370,0:16:40.250
for first off we rented

0:16:40.250,0:16:44.450
play around with research tools until we
can do so we can estes h two research

0:16:44.450,0:16:45.680
tools

0:16:45.680,0:16:49.610
etsy com dot image but i'm not going to
enter your man and actually put in

0:16:49.610,0:16:51.100
commands

0:16:51.100,0:16:53.340
through the type of stain

0:16:53.340,0:16:56.790
the sleazy assistant protocol the text
of a computer

0:16:56.790,0:16:57.720
animal actually run

0:16:57.720,0:16:59.170
in the hosting command

0:16:59.170,0:17:02.240
amrita results but uh... us here on the
local machine

0:17:02.240,0:17:04.089
so depressed enter

0:17:04.089,0:17:06.270
we get all of this annoying massive tom

0:17:06.270,0:17:09.340
and then we get back that this was
running on research tools

0:17:09.340,0:17:12.150
so do a quick demo of some of them

0:17:12.150,0:17:14.240
become like what you might actually do

0:17:14.240,0:17:16.050
with a cessation

0:17:16.050,0:17:20.420
both credo scripted that does the disk
usage on that serve meteor watching an

0:17:20.420,0:17:24.339
overtime as he pleases anyone make sure
that you can call f

0:17:24.339,0:17:29.670
died usage of accuracy how much to space
is needed on it for daily use

0:17:29.670,0:17:33.470
so we can do as the states to research
tools for place hostname

0:17:33.470,0:17:36.320
tends to be up there again to do the
command

0:17:36.320,0:17:37.370
history

0:17:37.370,0:17:39.190
full duty f

0:17:39.190,0:17:40.670
dash age

0:17:40.670,0:17:43.230
so that's disk usage

0:17:43.230,0:17:45.880
passages human readable story here

0:17:45.880,0:17:49.290
and dot as the current directory so
worried happens to be which should be

0:17:49.290,0:17:51.570
our home directory

0:17:51.570,0:17:54.809
presenter and you can see this is as if
we're running

0:17:54.809,0:17:56.970
d_f_ on that remote computer

0:17:56.970,0:17:59.690
and getting it back if we do it the f
dash h

0:17:59.690,0:18:00.990
dot locally

0:18:00.990,0:18:04.070
will see it looks very different things
were our local machine

0:18:04.070,0:18:07.800
and we have just one drive this is a
server with some other setup

0:18:07.800,0:18:09.309
and it's got a

0:18:09.309,0:18:13.900
different size disk it's got twenty-one
gigabytes using twenty percent

0:18:13.900,0:18:17.610
so what we can do is we need to first
get rid of this annoying message because

0:18:17.610,0:18:21.920
at this comes through all of our scripts
it's going to have us crazy

0:18:21.920,0:18:25.040
so we can do is

0:18:25.040,0:18:28.179
c were comes from for comes first
standard-bearer

0:18:28.179,0:18:31.590
there's two different streams of tax
coming out of programs their standard

0:18:31.590,0:18:33.440
output in standard bearer

0:18:33.440,0:18:37.140
error messages and warnings and why not
go to standard-bearer and your regular

0:18:37.140,0:18:38.720
texas a standout

0:18:38.720,0:18:43.370
we can go lamp that was kind of a funky
command redirected standard error

0:18:43.370,0:18:49.650
to someplace that neurosis appear canada
special final on unix machines

0:18:49.650,0:18:52.250
it's called uh... no

0:18:52.250,0:18:53.880
and ul

0:18:53.880,0:18:58.950
and that is a special file that you can
send anything you want to that file and

0:18:58.950,0:19:00.960
it will just gobble it up and throw it
out

0:19:00.960,0:19:03.150
it's the great departed in the sky

0:19:03.150,0:19:05.150
where boys go to dive

0:19:05.150,0:19:09.080
and you can send india you want their
just magically disappear so if we say

0:19:09.080,0:19:10.900
echo

0:19:10.900,0:19:13.580
hello world

0:19:13.580,0:19:16.060
if we redirect that too

0:19:16.060,0:19:18.370
to have known

0:19:18.370,0:19:22.180
nothing happens it just talk it's gone
and again that naal still looks like the

0:19:22.180,0:19:23.620
same

0:19:23.620,0:19:24.700
files in there

0:19:24.700,0:19:27.280
uh... with nothing going on

0:19:27.280,0:19:29.650
so if we do our asses sage commands

0:19:29.650,0:19:34.420
with our d f dash h dot

0:19:34.420,0:19:39.150
normally you're probably stooges the
greater the m we can say to you

0:19:39.150,0:19:40.610
and to use the number

0:19:40.610,0:19:43.970
reserved for standard bearer one the
standard out

0:19:43.970,0:19:45.160
three concerns

0:19:45.160,0:19:46.830
to rather than

0:19:46.830,0:19:50.820
more into are dead known

0:19:50.820,0:19:55.450
and if things work out right we should
just see the results of cardio

0:19:55.450,0:19:58.430
so that got rid of all of our warning
messages they'll be he need to be able

0:19:58.430,0:20:00.070
to you that

0:20:00.070,0:20:02.870
and if you want to improve this coming a
little bit

0:20:02.870,0:20:07.370
one wearing from falling it we don't
want to human readable and lynn gist

0:20:07.370,0:20:10.310
the machine readable one

0:20:10.310,0:20:14.070
and will send up to speed up the root
directory and then we'll piper to

0:20:14.070,0:20:15.820
correct

0:20:15.820,0:20:17.990
for

0:20:17.990,0:20:20.890
uh... my teeth to get rid of stuff so

0:20:20.890,0:20:23.730
dash for the is the inverse of

0:20:23.730,0:20:27.100
what we're looking for

0:20:27.100,0:20:29.990
we want to get rid of mapper

0:20:29.990,0:20:32.620
and they also want to get rid of
filesystem

0:20:32.620,0:20:36.420
so will give it the vertical bar for or
inside of a great command

0:20:36.420,0:20:39.140
final system

0:20:39.140,0:20:41.140
and now we have a nice little command

0:20:41.140,0:20:44.309
that

0:20:44.309,0:20:47.320
doesn't do exactly what i want for
sarcasm

0:20:47.320,0:20:51.289
analysts is going on

0:20:51.289,0:20:55.080
media grant for telegraphed that will
probably work a little better

0:20:55.080,0:20:56.080
there we go

0:20:56.080,0:21:00.380
i make this a little water

0:21:00.380,0:21:02.780
so we take a look here we are actually
of god

0:21:02.780,0:21:05.810
ellis commands putting out and just

0:21:05.810,0:21:08.430
the disk usage for that particular

0:21:08.430,0:21:11.539
directory for flash on my computer

0:21:11.539,0:21:15.770
and if we can do that then move onto the
next topic which is called crohn's c_r_

0:21:15.770,0:21:16.980
or end

0:21:16.980,0:21:18.450
man dash k

0:21:18.450,0:21:20.280
crime

0:21:20.280,0:21:21.950
and crime is

0:21:21.950,0:21:25.620
was called a mentor program that runs
are in the background and does work

0:21:41.860,0:21:44.270
paviter equals

0:21:44.270,0:21:47.900
and i'm gonna make it imax dash and
debbie for no windows sold here written

0:21:47.900,0:21:49.470
terminal online head

0:21:49.470,0:21:51.640
files

0:21:51.640,0:21:54.049
and let's take a quick look

0:21:54.049,0:21:55.039
at

0:21:55.039,0:21:56.200
but wrong

0:21:56.200,0:21:57.710
so you're the three

0:21:57.710,0:22:00.850
relevant entries in the mid eighties

0:22:00.850,0:22:02.720
so we can type man

0:22:02.720,0:22:04.330
prawn

0:22:04.330,0:22:07.260
and i will talk about the actual program
that runs

0:22:07.260,0:22:10.299
demands for you periodically in the
background

0:22:10.299,0:22:11.649
and there's to you

0:22:11.649,0:22:16.659
man pages of the same name here in some
we haven't seen before in the class

0:22:16.659,0:22:20.020
does number apprentice eases the section
of the main page

0:22:20.020,0:22:21.369
at the same and one

0:22:21.369,0:22:26.280
cronin that'll give us

0:22:26.280,0:22:28.530
mourned prime time

0:22:28.530,0:22:32.010
will give us the program manual page

0:22:32.010,0:22:37.440
and there's actually a primetime file
that's god's the set up for themselves

0:22:37.440,0:22:39.600
if we save five

0:22:39.600,0:22:42.870
this'll give us the actual thought
condition on the format of the father

0:22:42.870,0:22:44.330
were creating

0:22:44.330,0:22:45.929
including things like

0:22:45.929,0:22:47.389
has specified

0:22:47.389,0:22:51.639
operandi run nearly annually every time
the computer reboots or hourly things

0:22:51.639,0:22:53.870
like that they're pretty handy

0:22:53.870,0:22:56.370
so all the documentation is there on the
computer

0:22:56.370,0:23:01.179
now let's go ahead and take a look at
parker on time

0:23:01.179,0:23:03.730
now on this computer currently

0:23:03.730,0:23:09.270
no crime times for these orders actually
attached to each person's account

0:23:09.270,0:23:10.250
and

0:23:10.250,0:23:13.740
each person can create their own outcry
on and treats that will get run

0:23:13.740,0:23:18.090
periodically dash el esta lista con file
command

0:23:18.090,0:23:19.760
so we need to go ahead

0:23:19.760,0:23:24.169
and create uh... to mean that we're
gonna go ahead and put in

0:23:24.169,0:23:25.640
and we can save

0:23:25.640,0:23:28.090
cron tab dash eat

0:23:28.090,0:23:31.140
now what their content entry

0:23:31.140,0:23:35.260
now it's got some comments at this hour
the pound there are

0:23:35.260,0:23:37.010
hideously samples

0:23:37.010,0:23:39.340
florida go ahead and create a command

0:23:39.340,0:23:41.270
for ourselves that wall

0:23:41.270,0:23:42.320
that will work out

0:23:42.320,0:23:44.690
for creating

0:23:44.690,0:23:45.650
puranik

0:23:45.650,0:23:47.289
updates of

0:23:47.289,0:23:50.140
the disk usage of put into a log file
for s

0:23:50.140,0:23:53.320
chemical from the terminal to get ready
for what we're doing

0:23:53.320,0:23:55.470
and want to be able to grab a timestamp

0:23:55.470,0:23:57.160
so we can save data

0:23:57.160,0:23:58.659
we'll give you the time

0:23:58.659,0:24:01.190
but if we're gonna be fought in the
stuff down the road we don't really want

0:24:01.190,0:24:05.299
to i think it's not very useful week and
then tell dates to you

0:24:05.299,0:24:09.809
being yuki see because all timestamp
should be you can see in my opinion

0:24:09.809,0:24:12.390
and we can then say plus

0:24:12.390,0:24:15.830
and these are giving a format commands
if he can read the man page for day to

0:24:15.830,0:24:18.289
see all all of the uh...

0:24:18.289,0:24:20.550
since you can put in here so percent

0:24:20.550,0:24:22.169
wide use a year per cent

0:24:22.169,0:24:24.769
and gives you more and percent

0:24:24.769,0:24:26.430
deed for dave

0:24:26.430,0:24:32.119
ke to the break between the date and
time and then percent catholic

0:24:32.119,0:24:34.740
percent capital and

0:24:34.740,0:24:35.680
and then

0:24:35.680,0:24:37.549
might as well two percent

0:24:37.549,0:24:41.230
s with capital ananthi for zulu

0:24:41.230,0:24:42.280
to do that

0:24:42.280,0:24:44.460
it's gonna print out the and that time

0:24:44.460,0:24:48.590
well that looks nice and it's used by a
lot of software tools when plotting you

0:24:48.590,0:24:50.910
the best thing to do this to you date

0:24:50.910,0:24:52.030
as

0:24:52.030,0:24:53.980
how do you teach me unix

0:24:53.980,0:24:56.309
timestamp switches seconds from

0:24:56.309,0:25:00.400
was called epic which is nineteen
seventy thrusday

0:25:00.400,0:25:02.850
dates uh...

0:25:02.850,0:25:03.490
plus

0:25:03.490,0:25:05.170
percent house

0:25:05.170,0:25:07.600
and if we add dash dash duty-free

0:25:07.600,0:25:09.990
you can see that they're actually

0:25:09.990,0:25:13.650
it is and you can see so this is the
number of seconds since nineteen seventy

0:25:13.650,0:25:14.610
eight

0:25:14.610,0:25:17.990
and that number makes it very easy to
plot out pat

0:25:17.990,0:25:19.630
and do math with time

0:25:19.630,0:25:23.330
so use that as our tax tip him so much
for coming up

0:25:23.330,0:25:29.600
saturday two may never know when user
logfile

0:25:29.600,0:25:35.440
and let's go ahead mister building up or
command so if we're going to an echo

0:25:35.440,0:25:37.360
dash and

0:25:37.360,0:25:39.480
not put out a new line

0:25:39.480,0:25:44.360
the backhoe runs are shell script inside
of a command so

0:25:44.360,0:25:45.139
plus

0:25:45.139,0:25:47.440
percent house

0:25:47.440,0:25:51.040
suffragist ye that that's going to give
us our timestamp

0:25:51.040,0:25:53.980
and then after that reindeer estes h

0:25:53.980,0:25:55.140
researched

0:25:55.140,0:25:56.920
tools

0:25:56.920,0:26:01.590

0:26:12.309,0:26:17.510
slash stab slash no

0:26:17.510,0:26:19.900
and then we're going to you

0:26:19.900,0:26:20.679
he crept

0:26:20.679,0:26:23.670
minus the sorghum and get rid of

0:26:32.400,0:26:34.200
for food run that commands

0:26:34.200,0:26:37.140
you can see that it paused briefly right
here

0:26:37.140,0:26:39.610
acid rain this command locally to get
the date

0:26:39.610,0:26:42.490
and then it went off and got the
timestamp

0:26:42.490,0:26:45.120
now we want to your redirect that
someplace

0:26:45.120,0:26:48.340
sore actually do this we're going to
send that

0:26:48.340,0:26:49.210

strongly reviews

0:26:50.809,0:26:54.650
at greater length to redirect to a final
but we're gonna append to file to

0:26:54.650,0:26:56.429
greater than this

0:26:56.429,0:26:58.120
and then slash home

0:27:00.390,0:27:02.470
disc mark

0:27:02.470,0:27:06.250
night specified with absolute path so we
don't have to worry about till those

0:27:06.250,0:27:08.799
because prize winner in a funny
environment

0:27:08.799,0:27:12.010
just don't worry about having to you
it's been too much stuff

0:27:12.010,0:27:15.200
let's go ahead and hit enter to happens

0:27:15.200,0:27:18.580
and he didn't actually rate everything
too

0:27:18.580,0:27:22.110
the final so we need to rap

0:27:22.110,0:27:24.110
everything inside

0:27:24.110,0:27:28.899
here including

0:27:28.899,0:27:30.590
that doesn't attend

0:27:30.590,0:27:32.520
had control to redraw

0:27:32.520,0:27:33.520
to put it up

0:27:33.520,0:27:35.100
beginning your privacy act

0:27:35.100,0:27:36.660
before the ako

0:27:36.660,0:27:40.590
and an ending prentice c right before
the two greater bands in that will take

0:27:40.590,0:27:43.840
all that make that essentially one
command for the shell

0:27:43.840,0:27:46.780
take the alpha that and send it all to
you

0:27:46.780,0:27:49.700
the uh... disclosed

0:27:49.700,0:27:53.460
sophie saikat disc log

0:27:53.460,0:27:56.880
we have a line it didn't work out quite
right for violent is great

0:27:56.880,0:28:01.980
let's go ahead and move that far to stop
on

0:28:01.980,0:28:05.480
seller clean rady carol and now we need
to create arc runtime

0:28:05.480,0:28:08.900
that's gonna handle this copy

0:28:08.900,0:28:12.030
and it copy

0:28:12.030,0:28:13.260
hit it

0:28:13.260,0:28:14.380
paste

0:28:14.380,0:28:18.890
so that's what we're gonna run we do you
have to watch out for the percents

0:28:18.890,0:28:20.230
so

0:28:20.230,0:28:24.500
tied to the control a jump at the
beginning

0:28:24.500,0:28:28.410
if they put a backslash reports percent
it'll protected so that crime doesn't

0:28:28.410,0:28:32.370
try to fiddle with it otherwise they
won't get past correctly to you are

0:28:32.370,0:28:33.360
command

0:28:33.360,0:28:35.910
and now we have to specify the format

0:28:35.910,0:28:38.820
for when the scan is gonna get run so

0:28:38.820,0:28:41.970
as you see here is from hence minute
power

0:28:41.970,0:28:43.440

0:28:45.370,0:28:47.190
couple things in there

0:28:47.190,0:28:50.830
ran trial runs for starters every minute
so

0:28:50.830,0:28:54.510
enhancement here's zero two fifty nine

0:28:54.510,0:28:55.770
and then

0:28:55.770,0:28:58.350
uh... star means any hour

0:28:58.350,0:29:00.700
anyday

0:29:00.700,0:29:02.059
month and weak

signature unreimbursed are twenty three
four

0:29:04.860,0:29:06.210
okay good

0:29:06.210,0:29:09.230
so please save this

0:29:09.230,0:29:10.860
that should

0:29:10.860,0:29:14.670
create crunch time for us now knows that
there were a temporary file and that's

0:29:14.670,0:29:17.029
gonna copy that file over to the right
people

0:29:17.029,0:29:21.250
location for the computer keeps track of
it so that control x control seats

0:29:21.250,0:29:25.380
we've now installed our new crime time

0:29:25.380,0:29:28.539
and if we do you

0:29:28.539,0:29:30.440
detailed minus af

0:29:30.440,0:29:32.050
var along

0:29:32.050,0:29:35.039
sfas fog

0:29:35.039,0:29:36.230
you'll see that

0:29:36.230,0:29:37.309
great here

0:29:37.309,0:29:41.399
it was it kept track of the fact that we
and our prime time for the research

0:29:41.399,0:29:43.549
tools user account

0:29:43.549,0:29:47.070
and if we wait a little bit we should
see a new uh...

0:29:47.070,0:29:50.919
contact entry go into the log file
monthly to an hour specialist so there's

0:29:50.919,0:29:51.990
no

0:29:51.990,0:29:56.570
disc long variance with the date we'll
see you are about to come up on the moon

0:29:56.570,0:29:58.210
transition from

0:29:58.210,0:30:01.920
one twenty two two one twenty three

0:30:01.920,0:30:03.130
so jumped imminent

0:30:03.130,0:30:06.659
direct or a lot of folic actually see
recorded

0:30:06.659,0:30:08.799
running our command

0:30:08.799,0:30:10.789
so they're ran this

0:30:10.789,0:30:14.840
only complicate command word print out
the date stamped and then a cessation of

0:30:14.840,0:30:19.650
the research tools it got rid of the
warning messages rained here

0:30:19.650,0:30:22.210
and remove the matheran filesystem

0:30:22.210,0:30:26.090
and then it will go to the swamp five

0:30:26.090,0:30:29.330
so hopefully that made sense to use it
if you take any other classes in the

0:30:29.330,0:30:32.820
series out whats going some of those
have bash basics

0:30:32.820,0:30:37.500
for you know a special man we see we
have a disqualifier operate here so

0:30:37.500,0:30:40.070
feel myself disqualify

0:30:40.070,0:30:42.890
and we now have our first entry n

0:30:42.890,0:30:44.730
artist usage

0:30:44.730,0:30:48.380
so if somebody were copy a giant file
onto the research tools computer right

0:30:48.380,0:30:48.940
now

0:30:48.940,0:30:52.710
ardyss key sigil bleed change

0:30:52.710,0:30:54.820
simply as a sage

0:30:54.820,0:30:56.280
over to you

0:30:56.280,0:31:00.259
research tools

0:31:00.259,0:31:03.299
sitcom means

0:31:03.299,0:31:06.700
protect last and pipe lasts

0:31:06.700,0:31:11.130
will see that content in the few times

0:31:11.130,0:31:14.419
now we've got entries coming in with
different times

0:31:14.419,0:31:19.440
an artist usages rate their so if we
were to copy a file

0:31:19.440,0:31:22.700
and i think you every damn difficult in
the big file here

0:31:22.700,0:31:24.710
we carried

0:31:24.710,0:31:27.940
then cause something to you take a
disgrace and be able to track it here

0:31:27.940,0:31:32.929
and we t_v_'s numbers changing

0:31:32.929,0:31:35.640
so that's the basics of crime

0:31:35.640,0:31:39.200
uh... there's a lot to it and you can
spend time going through what's going on

0:31:39.200,0:31:40.519
and

0:31:40.519,0:31:44.320
it will uh... um...

0:31:44.320,0:31:48.100
take a little while to get really good
at it but it's very handy and they can

0:31:48.100,0:31:50.240
run stuff all the time

0:31:50.240,0:31:54.110
and we can then change stuff to be at
how we need to be so we can see control

0:31:54.110,0:31:54.779
c

0:31:54.779,0:31:56.030
do quickly

0:31:56.030,0:31:58.050
uh...

0:31:58.050,0:32:00.510
the crime town so if we say

0:32:00.510,0:32:03.210
contact that she first had it

0:32:03.210,0:32:07.080
there's lots of things you can't we can
agree on the bottom here we can say

0:32:07.080,0:32:08.660
slash five

0:32:08.660,0:32:10.169
and i'll run it

0:32:10.169,0:32:14.039
from missus urich fifty-nine every five
minutes

0:32:14.039,0:32:15.860
say that

0:32:15.860,0:32:20.360
and now has new content were only run
every five minutes

0:32:20.360,0:32:21.559
was very handy

0:32:21.559,0:32:23.360
d_n_a_ use cron jobs

0:32:23.360,0:32:26.930
well they're running on time for me
taking care of centered in the copying

0:32:26.930,0:32:29.299
files from one place to another

0:32:29.299,0:32:30.859
hailing things like

0:32:30.859,0:32:34.249
every time i get email from the u_s_
coast guard healy

0:32:34.249,0:32:38.129
actually have a con job that every hour
goes through and bills the latest

0:32:38.129,0:32:41.309
visualization for the ship

0:32:41.309,0:32:46.059
right so i'd like you one last thing
with esa sage before i let you go

0:32:46.059,0:32:50.000
and that's to haiti's it from inside of
you match to be able to at remote files

0:32:50.000,0:32:53.420
a specially if you're far away from the
computer file words

0:32:53.420,0:32:56.620
if you ask the sage through a computer
it takes time for a recovery keep

0:32:56.620,0:33:00.050
receipt you hit to go back out to that
computer

0:33:00.050,0:33:02.900
do change and then come back to you

0:33:02.900,0:33:07.130
and that can be really annoying when
those delays get long and disk it's very

0:33:07.130,0:33:11.240
hard to work with remote files
efficiently it's very doable but it's

0:33:11.240,0:33:13.669
also a lot easier to be working

0:33:13.669,0:33:17.610
locally it with imax and working with
the file

0:33:17.610,0:33:22.510
so i'm gonna try and here she is a tool
called tramped inside of you max

0:33:22.510,0:33:28.140
and tramp is a system for using as a
stage n_f_l_ sees other protocols

0:33:28.140,0:33:32.150
to ground files on different computers
at them locally and every time you get

0:33:32.150,0:33:36.950
saved you'll use as a stage two go back
to that on the computer

0:33:36.950,0:33:40.020
and the key thing is that if you have to
take your password every time you hit

0:33:40.020,0:33:42.300
save your gonna go crazy

0:33:42.300,0:33:43.950
i certainly can't take that

0:33:43.950,0:33:48.520
so having your asses each key so that
makes it pretty easy to do

0:33:48.520,0:33:51.919
solicitors who worked in trolex control
f

0:33:51.919,0:33:52.740
and

0:33:52.740,0:33:54.320
now i can say

0:33:54.320,0:33:56.039
sloshed

0:33:56.039,0:33:59.680
s_s_-eighteen colin classes voting tramp

0:33:59.680,0:34:03.809
we're now have that module running and
we can say research

0:34:03.809,0:34:06.909
tools dot ccom diane h

0:34:06.909,0:34:11.270
colin and then will to say dot for the
current working directory will make it

0:34:11.270,0:34:13.539
to their such as we are home directory

0:34:13.539,0:34:15.319
i pressed enter

0:34:15.319,0:34:18.490
wouldn't waiting for a bookshelf alamo
shall

0:34:18.490,0:34:19.859
time now adding

0:34:19.859,0:34:24.399
the directory upon the room she just
like that kitty jerod on the current

0:34:24.399,0:34:25.559
computer

0:34:25.559,0:34:26.699
so i can

0:34:26.699,0:34:28.360
create a file called hello

0:34:28.360,0:34:30.429
world

0:34:30.429,0:34:32.589
t x t

0:34:32.589,0:34:33.859
hi there

0:34:33.859,0:34:37.179
and if i say this control x control
house

0:34:37.179,0:34:40.139
you can see it's right in the file out
across the desk

0:34:40.139,0:34:42.059
and if we as a stage

0:34:42.059,0:34:43.490
to a research

0:34:43.490,0:34:46.539
tools dot secom dot image

0:34:46.539,0:34:51.719
we can do in dallas dash coltie are for
part-time panic disorder

0:34:51.719,0:34:53.429
and we have a file called

0:34:53.429,0:34:55.899
hello world

0:34:55.899,0:34:57.249
and pc

0:34:57.249,0:34:58.479
hostname

0:34:58.479,0:35:02.039
we can see that that his our research
tools computer that's remote from our

0:35:02.039,0:35:03.199
laptop

0:35:03.199,0:35:06.019
so reading a final harm a computer

0:35:06.019,0:35:07.329
and

0:35:07.329,0:35:10.539
it just works so again the command is

0:35:10.539,0:35:15.409
uh... find file control x control of
greeting to continue tom

0:35:15.409,0:35:17.979
and then sloshed s_h_ colin

0:35:17.979,0:35:20.589
the hosting is right here

0:35:20.589,0:35:23.729
that colin and then work what you'd like
to add

0:35:23.729,0:35:27.289
so dispatch pray here is justin pathak
you normally would

0:35:27.289,0:35:28.609
used on

0:35:28.609,0:35:30.169
a local computer

0:35:30.169,0:35:33.769
and that's all there is a tramp uh... it
takes a little bit if you have problems

0:35:33.769,0:35:35.119
with it

0:35:35.119,0:35:38.289
it doesn't give you a very good error
messages so i suggest starting over from

0:35:38.289,0:35:40.019
scratch in trying again

0:35:40.019,0:35:43.439
or find someone who's comfortable it ran
to get get you through the first little

0:35:43.439,0:35:44.389
dates

0:35:44.389,0:35:47.479
but it's definitely an amazing tool for
doing

0:35:47.479,0:35:52.559
pending a files an engine data on the
computers such that especially if you're

0:35:52.559,0:35:54.499
going over satellite links

0:35:54.499,0:35:58.609
tranny files externally is of little
pain

0:35:58.609,0:36:00.769
thanks for joining and that's research
tools twenty
