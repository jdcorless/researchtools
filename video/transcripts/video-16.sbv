hello my name is purchased where tenses
research tools video sixteen

0:00:06.440,0:00:13.169
camera talked today about simple signal
processing using num pride and typed on

0:00:13.169,0:00:17.099
pretzels go ahead and get started for
entrance and basics of signal processing

0:00:17.099,0:00:22.900
will say high place on dash dash pylon
yourself into a python environment

0:00:22.900,0:00:26.980
and number hai provides some nice
functionality for working with the rays

0:00:26.980,0:00:30.329
so we can construct some basic signal
states

0:00:30.329,0:00:32.160
the first one take a look at

0:00:32.160,0:00:36.380
is to make the boxcar so we can say
zeros

0:00:36.380,0:00:42.120
and the zeros functions it lets us
create a list upper an array of

0:00:42.120,0:00:45.460
zero still say zeros

0:00:45.460,0:00:48.790
in will make about two hundred of them

0:00:48.790,0:00:50.840
so there's an array of two hundred
cereals

0:00:50.840,0:00:54.800
anamika boxcar when have zeros fall by
one's phone blazers

0:00:54.800,0:00:57.220
city council yonews

0:00:57.220,0:00:58.730
one hundred and

0:00:58.730,0:01:00.690
and there's a hundred one

0:01:00.690,0:01:05.220
and what we can do that in this can
cadmium these together so we can say

0:01:05.220,0:01:07.429
and patni casket

0:01:07.429,0:01:09.240
a little bit about self

0:01:09.240,0:01:13.479
so we can can techniques have for all
race together okay and uh... gloom

0:01:13.479,0:01:19.009
clinic at its allstate and patni

0:01:19.009,0:01:20.690
and will make a list

0:01:20.690,0:01:24.010
so we're gonna fill up this list with
ones

0:01:24.010,0:01:27.340
let's make it a little bit bigger so a
thousand of them

0:01:27.340,0:01:30.690
followed by maybe uh... will save

0:01:30.690,0:01:33.030
also is there a suspect there

0:01:33.030,0:01:35.659
view rooms

0:01:35.659,0:01:39.710
ones so make uh... about two hundred
votes

0:01:39.710,0:01:42.130
and zeros

0:01:42.130,0:01:46.720
one thousand

0:01:46.720,0:01:49.530
simply have my prints these freight so
there we go

0:01:49.530,0:01:51.210
now we really want

0:01:51.210,0:01:55.270
rather than using count five which pic
dealing with the state data equals

0:01:55.270,0:01:59.390
and we can do a quick talk about the
plot data

0:01:59.390,0:02:02.590
piano bring that to a first for a trip
to see it

0:02:02.590,0:02:06.530
and there you have a simple square wave
or boxcar

0:02:06.530,0:02:09.759
so we can do some interesting things
with them for example maybe one of the

0:02:09.759,0:02:13.240
apply hemming filter and if you don't
know him a filter looks like we'll just

0:02:13.240,0:02:16.009
go ahead and create one so to say

0:02:16.009,0:02:17.499
hemming

0:02:17.499,0:02:19.150
uh... will meet you meet me

0:02:19.150,0:02:20.169
thirty

0:02:20.169,0:02:21.579
samples for them

0:02:21.579,0:02:22.489
and that

0:02:22.489,0:02:28.180
is a hint of their doesn't look like
much does it all say

0:02:28.180,0:02:34.969
we'll bring that in and it's just a
simple responsible shape

0:02:34.969,0:02:37.059
if we bring them back

0:02:37.059,0:02:38.590
if we look here it

0:02:38.590,0:02:41.890
peaks to warn if you in a great honor
this curve if it's going to be much more

0:02:41.890,0:02:44.379
than one so if we

0:02:44.379,0:02:48.989
going apply this filter to our data it's
actually been increased the

0:02:48.989,0:02:50.470
people to of our signal

0:02:50.470,0:02:54.429
so even normalize its so that it sums to
one so we can say

0:02:54.429,0:03:01.239
hemming up thirty in the detectives some
of bands serpents salman

0:03:01.239,0:03:03.959
and that comes out for higher than one

0:03:03.959,0:03:06.310
so what we can do is say

0:03:06.310,0:03:09.099
are filter

0:03:09.099,0:03:11.090
copy filter

0:03:11.090,0:03:13.089
equals

0:03:13.089,0:03:14.060
thirty

0:03:14.060,0:03:17.949
and we'll divide by the some of uh...
total filter

0:03:17.949,0:03:20.459
simply say some okay

0:03:20.459,0:03:21.419
filter

0:03:21.419,0:03:22.730
we get back one

0:03:22.730,0:03:27.639
so it's a plot g

0:03:27.639,0:03:34.639
and here's our filter and if you notice
that this is much lower

0:03:35.089,0:03:39.199
so let's go ahead and learn how to
control for arsenals together so we can

0:03:39.199,0:03:41.379
say

0:03:41.379,0:03:45.299
involve question mark in the gas cooktop
involved

0:03:45.299,0:03:49.130
so here we have to play to raise
together and unity

0:03:49.130,0:03:51.729
and nobody thought silicon saying

0:03:51.729,0:03:55.029
can involve

0:03:55.029,0:03:56.659
the where

0:03:56.659,0:03:58.969
j filter

0:03:58.969,0:04:02.139
and we get back in a rate it doesn't
look like much of a commitment to run a

0:04:02.139,0:04:05.109
plot that treated plots

0:04:05.109,0:04:07.779
involved

0:04:07.779,0:04:12.629
there's our convo filter animals also
plots partido along with this we can see

0:04:12.629,0:04:14.399
the difference between the two

0:04:14.399,0:04:17.159
so what actually happens here is that
it's

0:04:17.159,0:04:20.530
kind not together and it's a little hard
to see here

0:04:20.530,0:04:25.949
uh... it brown's the edges with him a
filter

0:04:25.949,0:04:29.789
we can also generate raman signals so we
can say

0:04:29.789,0:04:31.749
brand

0:04:31.749,0:04:33.469
and

0:04:33.469,0:04:38.810
one hundred or one thousand the image of
random stuff so we can save plots

0:04:38.810,0:04:39.720
and

0:04:39.720,0:04:42.870
here it is some random data

0:04:42.870,0:04:47.020
we can also take it for a transfer
announcements eight ten fifty

0:04:47.020,0:04:53.309
ray and and one thousand or maybe ten
twenty four

0:04:53.309,0:04:57.669
doesn't look like much but then we can
save wants

0:04:57.669,0:04:59.429
proper credits he's in there

0:04:59.429,0:05:03.400
and

0:05:03.400,0:05:07.569
simply plug the a fiftieth that they
have there is the story transfer about

0:05:07.569,0:05:08.710
it

0:05:08.710,0:05:11.039
doesn't take much because when india

0:05:11.039,0:05:14.629
but that should be uh... let's get you
started thinking about signal processing

0:05:14.629,0:05:17.019
anti-klan

0:05:17.019,0:05:17.529
so thanks for joining
