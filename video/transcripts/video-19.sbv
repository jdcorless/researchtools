0:00:04.779,0:00:09.449
for research tools the you in a chicago
jc

0:00:09.449,0:00:14.389
cards on this will be on the career or
htm also known

0:00:14.389,0:00:16.309
personal from mercury

0:00:16.309,0:00:20.250
and mercurial is a revision control
systems that will be taking a look at in

0:00:20.250,0:00:22.719
this video

0:00:22.719,0:00:26.529
so let me jump into it and start with
introduction

0:00:26.529,0:00:30.269
him let's first talk about version
control and tracking

0:00:30.269,0:00:34.120
how things like software the first thing
to note is that

0:00:34.120,0:00:36.760
hike email is not a proper backup system

0:00:36.760,0:00:38.450
it doesn't really give you

0:00:38.450,0:00:42.510
hanging way to deal with differences
between things

0:00:42.510,0:00:45.160
uh... also looking at a rate here is
that

0:00:45.160,0:00:48.930
the tracking changing and word doesn't
really give you the same functionality

0:00:48.930,0:00:50.830
we talked about today so it's

0:00:50.830,0:00:52.989
trying to sell more of it doesn't really
give you

0:00:52.989,0:00:54.470
much of which might see a bit

0:00:54.470,0:00:58.170
you might have seen the tracking changes
in word

0:00:58.170,0:00:59.399
uh... local

0:00:59.399,0:01:02.880
police systems like time machine on the
mac where you can

0:01:02.880,0:01:06.530
have the computer track changes and be
able to go back

0:01:06.530,0:01:09.810
those are good things but they don't
give you the same functionality

0:01:09.810,0:01:13.600
and again after reading that doesn't
also give you wish you'd like is

0:01:13.600,0:01:16.360
datingsite dropbox can trigger sank

0:01:16.360,0:01:19.619
where they're tracking more files and
not to the clouds

0:01:19.619,0:01:22.780
they often have tools to let you see if
you persons but

0:01:22.780,0:01:25.700
again they don't give you all the
functionality of a true revision control

0:01:25.700,0:01:26.820
system

0:01:26.820,0:01:30.790
so well those are definitely helpful
they're not what we want forever things

0:01:30.790,0:01:33.850
we'd like to have more than just does

0:01:33.850,0:01:37.479
and let's take a quick peek at the
history of free and open source software

0:01:37.479,0:01:39.939
revision control systems

0:01:39.939,0:01:45.320
and that way back when how we had
revision control system which is a local

0:01:45.320,0:01:47.999
only it only deal for the local computer
and uh...

0:01:47.999,0:01:50.050
subdirectories in

0:01:50.050,0:01:52.010
files

0:01:52.010,0:01:56.270
is really only hint of one percent i'm
very effectively

0:01:56.270,0:01:59.579
and it's while it's useful it's
definitely been superseded you no longer

0:01:59.579,0:02:01.960
need to really learn her c_s_

0:02:01.960,0:02:04.920
the things that i would have used this
for uh...

0:02:04.920,0:02:06.149
upto recently

0:02:06.149,0:02:08.340
have been taken over very effectively by

0:02:08.340,0:02:12.169
typing secretarial walcott today

0:02:12.169,0:02:16.459
the once people got used to be a live
version control things locally they also

0:02:16.459,0:02:19.129
want to be able to work in groups and a
half

0:02:19.129,0:02:23.239
outside locations where your sinking
west courage in history

0:02:23.239,0:02:24.459
and one of the early

0:02:24.459,0:02:28.289
very popular once was concurrent
versions system

0:02:28.289,0:02:32.289
it's pretty effectively it's still in
use today by quite a few projects as a

0:02:32.289,0:02:33.769
little crusty

0:02:33.769,0:02:36.299
but i think it's the job done but

0:02:36.299,0:02:40.309
it's got some edges where it's very hard
to do things like managed directories

0:02:40.309,0:02:42.169
and files around

0:02:42.169,0:02:43.529
uh... it definitely

0:02:43.529,0:02:44.829
need some help

0:02:44.829,0:02:50.789
and people then try to improve on cd s
with a system called subversion

0:02:50.789,0:02:52.119
or sdn

0:02:52.119,0:02:53.810
and subversion

0:02:53.810,0:02:57.779
and in t_v_ ads have this idea of a
centralized repository of it

0:02:57.779,0:03:02.430
make we were contagious locally and then
you pushed into the central site

0:03:02.430,0:03:06.959
and that's great for some systems but in
this course of the year definite dealing

0:03:06.959,0:03:11.629
with people who go to see in don't
always have internet access at all times

0:03:11.629,0:03:14.180
so things like subversion and c_v_s_

0:03:14.180,0:03:17.510
when you go up the shipping you don't
have a great internet access for even

0:03:17.510,0:03:18.559
any at all

0:03:18.559,0:03:21.979
it becomes very hard to work and you
might have to work for a couple weeks

0:03:21.979,0:03:23.709
and then put in changes

0:03:23.709,0:03:28.469
for all sorts of things on one date back
to the end and that's not very effective

0:03:28.469,0:03:31.069
there's ways to work around mt by
cloning

0:03:31.069,0:03:34.480
subversion repositories and then doing
some thinking

0:03:34.480,0:03:39.090
while that different works if it's not
necessarily very elegant

0:03:39.090,0:03:42.189
uh... with their lives colonel way back
when

0:03:42.189,0:03:46.099
there was actually a system of things
where they manage patches and the tool

0:03:46.099,0:03:47.659
called quilt

0:03:47.659,0:03:48.669
that

0:03:48.669,0:03:50.409
pad

0:03:50.409,0:03:54.209
the ability deal with pat sets and being
able to manage things for events to be a

0:03:54.209,0:03:58.509
mechanism but it really was pretty loose
and

0:03:58.509,0:04:01.980
i've never tried it because i really fit
my work model very well

0:04:01.980,0:04:05.809
uh... is pretty powerful and useful

0:04:05.809,0:04:08.249
and the gold standard today

0:04:08.249,0:04:11.439
with revision control systems of
something called distributed revision

0:04:11.439,0:04:13.250
control systems and that's where

0:04:13.250,0:04:17.509
you have a local server tight model
where you can interact with

0:04:17.509,0:04:21.340
uh... changes locally you can connect
them to show them to talk to some remote

0:04:21.340,0:04:23.470
server that you would with

0:04:23.470,0:04:26.080
c_v_s_ and subversion

0:04:26.080,0:04:29.739
but you can then push between various
repositories and you can create the

0:04:29.739,0:04:32.520
concept of a central server if you'd
like

0:04:32.520,0:04:36.710
and they don't have to but you can't can
you can also have multiple our sites out

0:04:36.710,0:04:39.910
on the web where your pen pushing your
changes too

0:04:39.910,0:04:41.090
and there isn't

0:04:41.090,0:04:42.740
a good number of these

0:04:42.740,0:04:44.860
press in the early ones are arches

0:04:44.860,0:04:46.940
hand is art

0:04:46.940,0:04:50.259
these are used by some projects but that
you could common ones that most people

0:04:50.259,0:04:55.780
use today target and material gets was
created by last four balls that and

0:04:55.780,0:04:57.649
uh... the creator of one x

0:04:57.649,0:04:59.180
and is

0:04:59.180,0:05:03.060
very similar to material it's a little
bit speedier maybe it's got a lot more

0:05:03.060,0:05:04.489
functionality

0:05:04.489,0:05:08.820
but material is the the little bit more
clean simple designed

0:05:08.820,0:05:09.990
interface

0:05:09.990,0:05:11.480
and hot

0:05:11.480,0:05:14.540
you know doesn't really matter where
these getter mercurial behera be showing

0:05:14.540,0:05:16.270
the material because

0:05:16.270,0:05:17.439
uh...

0:05:17.439,0:05:20.449
and that leads us to our next thing of
wire material

0:05:20.449,0:05:21.479
died

0:05:21.479,0:05:25.789
main reason is that seek thomas's side
to make it it's defaults

0:05:25.789,0:05:30.029
revision control system that they
support from nike team uh... could just

0:05:30.029,0:05:31.660
as easily abused its but

0:05:31.660,0:05:32.690
it's good to be

0:05:32.690,0:05:34.500
purity com working with

0:05:34.500,0:05:35.889
the same tools

0:05:35.889,0:05:39.330
ankit speedily to work offline so it's
the same as kids

0:05:39.330,0:05:43.499
and socialized for ka servers that
required but mccurry was actually pretty

0:05:43.499,0:05:47.300
polish in terms of its user interface
and

0:05:47.300,0:05:50.229
it's a lot simpler than get so we
figured that that'll probably be a good

0:05:50.229,0:05:52.650
thing to use form of scientists

0:05:52.650,0:05:55.590
now if you start with liquor you could
switch to get later on our

0:05:55.590,0:06:01.509
back-and-forth over people for the same
time this place to pull that off

0:06:01.509,0:06:02.390
and

0:06:02.390,0:06:05.379
in the sea all list i've got some good
links for you

0:06:05.379,0:06:07.409
uh... htm its

0:06:07.409,0:06:12.930
is our web site that's kind of fun by
uh... tolls boesky in in this tool

0:06:12.930,0:06:13.980
its fiscal web

0:06:13.980,0:06:15.650
introduction to

0:06:15.650,0:06:19.209
material and takes you through steps of

0:06:19.209,0:06:21.729
getting your halo around

0:06:21.729,0:06:25.439
material and i highly recommend reading
this it's uh... very fun well put

0:06:25.439,0:06:26.569
together site

0:06:26.569,0:06:29.440
now you can probably skip the
re-education of

0:06:29.440,0:06:30.889
for switching from

0:06:30.889,0:06:34.189
subversion to material if you haven't
done revision control when you're not

0:06:34.189,0:06:36.139
hopped on subversion

0:06:36.139,0:06:40.500
it's actually easier to learn material
if you haven't done some version first

0:06:40.500,0:06:46.389
because the actor concerts in mercurial
are very different than subversion

0:06:46.389,0:06:47.319
hinted

0:06:47.319,0:06:50.430
it's got some ideas of talking about how
to work in teams

0:06:50.430,0:06:55.539
uh... have worked up to about sixty
people with c_b_s_ handgun few process

0:06:55.539,0:06:57.259
version of the few people

0:06:57.259,0:07:02.009
ankit immaterial can also handle large
teams fairly easily and

0:07:02.009,0:07:03.879
uh... obese people say

0:07:03.879,0:07:08.280
kind kit and clinics colonel handling
very large numbers of people working

0:07:08.280,0:07:10.129
together

0:07:10.129,0:07:15.409
so it's a very handy sites

0:07:15.409,0:07:19.899
uh... there's also a free online book
specie book you can also buy that as a

0:07:19.899,0:07:21.150
dead tree or

0:07:21.150,0:07:23.110
real physical book

0:07:23.110,0:07:26.789
and as if your links that are helpful in
terms of uh... looking at

0:07:26.789,0:07:31.169
trickery

0:07:31.169,0:07:36.749
so we'll start off looking at some of
material and using it from our symbol or

0:07:36.749,0:07:37.909
use case

0:07:37.909,0:07:41.659
so start off by looking at someone
else's repository

0:07:41.659,0:07:45.159
so what you can do is if someone's put
something up in the cloud that you'd

0:07:45.159,0:07:46.389
like to use that incident

0:07:46.389,0:07:47.470
needed

0:07:47.470,0:07:50.150
or destroy the material format

0:07:50.150,0:07:54.460
what we can do is we can clone act or a
local tree and start to work with those

0:07:54.460,0:07:56.139
files

0:07:56.139,0:07:58.620
so i'm gonna show you briefly

0:07:58.620,0:07:59.889
um...

0:07:59.889,0:08:01.189
the site that i have

0:08:01.189,0:08:02.240
for

0:08:02.240,0:08:04.509
research tools that ccom

0:08:04.509,0:08:05.960
and what i've done is

0:08:05.960,0:08:09.400
post the research tools class notes into

0:08:09.400,0:08:11.389
uh... material site

0:08:11.389,0:08:14.039
still be able to work with these things
and

0:08:14.039,0:08:18.060
the actual site so let's go ahead and
clone that to follow the instructions

0:08:18.060,0:08:19.599
here

0:08:19.599,0:08:21.770
so i'm gonna go into

0:08:21.770,0:08:25.129
my tree here

0:08:25.129,0:08:31.449
if i can actually use this for the
trackpad

0:08:31.449,0:08:32.600
expect so

0:08:32.600,0:08:36.209
see till the swatches get this back in
our main home directory

0:08:36.209,0:08:38.110
soar in the research tools

0:08:38.110,0:08:41.370
home directory if you're using a virtual
machine for class

0:08:41.370,0:08:47.220
lichter projects i really have this
direct resellers exist cv projects

0:08:47.220,0:08:51.090
in in here before i have research tools
for a check this out

0:08:51.090,0:08:52.910
i'm going to you

0:08:52.910,0:08:57.400
uh... moved inside of the way so
research tools

0:08:57.400,0:09:01.290
cold research tools

0:09:01.290,0:09:04.830
so going to go ahead into

0:09:04.830,0:09:10.060
his cheek long term is going to go ahead
and copy paste tool on your own

0:09:10.060,0:09:12.310
madad w

0:09:12.310,0:09:13.430
me and

0:09:13.430,0:09:14.860
page that in there

0:09:14.860,0:09:17.890
press center this is going to reach out
to the departed site

0:09:17.890,0:09:21.140
and check out the actual repository

0:09:21.140,0:09:24.500
now if we look here in a bit docket site
they actually show you

0:09:24.500,0:09:28.140
this comming and had a clone that
repository

0:09:28.140,0:09:29.269
for the vector

0:09:29.269,0:09:33.570
research tools there

0:09:33.570,0:09:35.810
amber and go ahead and run this

0:09:35.810,0:09:37.750
it's gonna go check out

0:09:37.750,0:09:38.840
all of that

0:09:38.840,0:09:40.340
uh... stuff

0:09:40.340,0:09:45.420
whatever it was in that repository bring
it down to our local machine

0:09:45.420,0:09:47.190
so we can tell us

0:09:47.190,0:09:51.820
and we see as a research tools
directories or special research tools

0:09:51.820,0:09:55.280
and so i will see that there's a whole
tree of stuff that's come down from that

0:09:55.280,0:09:57.750
server that's now being tracked

0:09:57.750,0:09:59.270
and over time

0:09:59.270,0:10:03.500
when somebody else puts changes in that
repository mike to bring them down to

0:10:03.500,0:10:05.100
this particular

0:10:05.100,0:10:06.790
account on this computer

0:10:06.790,0:10:08.029
you can tab

0:10:08.029,0:10:10.370
told the updates and

0:10:10.370,0:10:13.380
will go ahead and do that even though
there's nothing to do

0:10:13.380,0:10:16.780
right now since no seems to happen in
the last few seconds

0:10:16.780,0:10:23.680
but it's a good exercise granted anselm
fetal slash projects research tools

0:10:23.680,0:10:26.000
and we can only if she

0:10:26.000,0:10:30.310
poll command which will bring down the
contingents

0:10:30.310,0:10:32.770
and will see here that there were
actually

0:10:32.770,0:10:36.420
no changes found which is expected

0:10:36.420,0:10:40.280
if there were changes in one-third
pulled down into the repository they're

0:10:40.280,0:10:43.620
not actually applied to the local files
and so you ask it to you

0:10:43.620,0:10:46.280
so we can actually do you

0:10:46.280,0:10:50.420
and htm update and the front

0:10:50.420,0:10:54.970
in our instructions we have use g

0:10:54.970,0:10:58.160
schools history

0:10:58.160,0:11:02.760
and in this case there were zero files
updated no merges told files removed no

0:11:02.760,0:11:05.040
conflicts

0:11:05.040,0:11:10.690
life is good here we have a repository
it's up to date

0:11:10.690,0:11:12.360
and what's reply

0:11:12.360,0:11:15.700
examine that repository on pickpocket so

0:11:15.700,0:11:21.110
mostly sokaya periods sites that provide
revision control hosting sites for you

0:11:21.110,0:11:24.240
will provide lots of tools there's a
number of them out there there's google

0:11:24.240,0:11:24.690
co

0:11:24.690,0:11:26.680
older there's pickpockets

0:11:26.680,0:11:28.980
there's lots of ones forget to

0:11:28.980,0:11:30.549
and i believe get hamas

0:11:30.549,0:11:32.490
picked up material support

0:11:32.490,0:11:34.930
so let's go ahead and take a look at

0:11:34.930,0:11:38.770
that but it's a for

0:11:38.770,0:11:43.120
research tools him as a number of things
to take a peek at so the overviews where

0:11:43.120,0:11:44.620
we start off

0:11:44.620,0:11:49.460
it's got a little read me about the
project now you can download the site

0:11:49.460,0:11:52.340
uh... tools of that

0:11:52.340,0:11:54.690
tar would use it to present

0:11:54.690,0:11:56.400
sees it too

0:11:56.400,0:11:58.010
possible options there

0:11:58.010,0:11:59.420
we can also take a look

0:11:59.420,0:12:02.580
at the source code

0:12:02.580,0:12:05.980
midterm following directions here yet to
browse the source

0:12:05.980,0:12:09.700
sewing here once you're in the source
time which is right here

0:12:09.700,0:12:13.510
we can go ahead and looked down here in
washington d the same directory

0:12:13.510,0:12:15.610
structure as we have before

0:12:15.610,0:12:17.420
so you can click on things like

0:12:17.420,0:12:18.770
scripts

0:12:18.770,0:12:20.639
and it tells you that

0:12:20.639,0:12:25.170
it was changed forever to go and have a
message of initial version post comments

0:12:25.170,0:12:27.520
how big is the file you can click on it

0:12:27.520,0:12:30.750
annual take a peek at uh... script

0:12:30.750,0:12:32.940
so it's very nice to be able to

0:12:32.940,0:12:37.170
take a peek at the site and to all sorts
of stuff with looking at it without

0:12:37.170,0:12:41.580
having to use the command line or even
have the coat check up and cheer

0:12:41.580,0:12:43.700
how working directory and in place

0:12:43.700,0:12:46.570
those are nice

0:12:46.570,0:12:48.480
now to talk we have

0:12:48.480,0:12:51.520
i've had called commits

0:12:51.520,0:12:52.910
intimates

0:12:52.910,0:12:54.360
well actually see

0:12:54.360,0:12:56.580
uh... treaty of changes now

0:12:56.580,0:13:00.780
it's just me working as project and i
haven't made what are called forks of

0:13:00.780,0:13:03.190
the code antony branching

0:13:03.190,0:13:06.430
in terms of working on multi will
concept in the same time ministering to

0:13:06.430,0:13:09.250
bring them back together to on the left
here

0:13:09.250,0:13:12.900
are treated as a single straight-line
without too much going on

0:13:12.900,0:13:17.010
it says who is the author and it's great
because you can collaborate and

0:13:17.010,0:13:21.150
merciless together from different people
as you try to collaborate on stuff

0:13:21.150,0:13:25.080
that revision numbers are a little bit
funky with chicken material

0:13:25.080,0:13:28.660
it switched from version one two three
four

0:13:28.660,0:13:29.860
cetera

0:13:29.860,0:13:32.870
that's used in cv essence version two

0:13:32.870,0:13:34.930
using a hash tag

0:13:34.930,0:13:35.720
and

0:13:35.720,0:13:40.660
liesl crazy numbers relate to the actual
changes

0:13:40.660,0:13:43.720
they're not very user friendly but
they're very unique and they were quite

0:13:43.720,0:13:44.780
well

0:13:44.780,0:13:48.200
i want to get used to them there's a
star pieces without really worrying too

0:13:48.200,0:13:49.790
much about them

0:13:49.790,0:13:51.919
first go ahead and take a peek at one

0:13:51.919,0:13:54.650
so if we take a look at a particular
patch

0:13:54.650,0:13:56.140
we can then see

0:13:56.140,0:13:58.190
scroll down here a little bit

0:13:58.190,0:14:00.750
we can take a peek inside of

0:14:00.750,0:14:05.170
particular file and see what's been
changed serve green as additions

0:14:05.170,0:14:06.380
red

0:14:06.380,0:14:09.420
installations if your colorblind i'm
very sorry

0:14:09.420,0:14:12.410
that many people haven't realized that
red and green are

0:14:12.410,0:14:16.020
that traces of color schemes

0:14:16.020,0:14:19.090
so you can go through the uh... commit
history and you can take a peek at

0:14:19.090,0:14:23.170
what's changed throughout time and you
can look at what's going on and track

0:14:23.170,0:14:25.050
what's going on a project

0:14:25.050,0:14:28.360
and if you need to figure out what's
suddenly broke in and britain he hadn't

0:14:28.360,0:14:30.870
used something for while you switch to
it

0:14:30.870,0:14:37.870
and from exchange these are ways you can
track and look in to see what's going on

0:14:39.460,0:14:40.860
that works pretty well

0:14:40.860,0:14:41.519
um...

0:14:41.519,0:14:42.910
we can also

0:14:42.910,0:14:44.870
if you look at the senate version

0:14:44.870,0:14:47.050
something click on this link here

0:14:47.050,0:14:49.120
when you go through the source to read

0:14:49.120,0:14:53.880
and you look at say that script if we
pick on alaska back your source you can

0:14:53.880,0:14:56.380
see it's with the consul works

0:14:56.380,0:14:58.490
we're going to scripts

0:14:58.490,0:15:01.720
and if you look at our screen capture
dot bash shell script

0:15:01.720,0:15:04.400
if you look at what are you are a lot of
the top here

0:15:04.400,0:15:05.970
and actually has

0:15:05.970,0:15:07.730
hash tag in there

0:15:07.730,0:15:08.720
now if you want

0:15:08.720,0:15:12.710
deal to link to the most recent version
as things change

0:15:12.710,0:15:14.450
can replace this with

0:15:14.450,0:15:15.860
the word tip

0:15:15.860,0:15:17.300
instead of having that

0:15:17.300,0:15:19.590
hash tag in there

0:15:19.590,0:15:20.970
presenter

0:15:20.970,0:15:23.360
and that you are all then will track

0:15:23.360,0:15:26.840
the latest version so if you give that
to someone with tippin there instead of

0:15:26.840,0:15:27.770
the

0:15:27.770,0:15:28.890
perhaps tag

0:15:28.890,0:15:32.400
to always be seen wafers and it's up to
you and i know you want to join us to be

0:15:32.400,0:15:34.510
consistent never change

0:15:34.510,0:15:38.280
soon attract the most recent changes

0:15:38.280,0:15:40.849
so that was here in terms of the most
recent

0:15:40.849,0:15:44.890
uh... with that

0:15:44.890,0:15:48.790
right so let's switch from examining the
repository

0:15:48.790,0:15:49.570
uh...

0:15:49.570,0:15:53.220
on the web to see you look at it locally

0:15:53.220,0:15:57.060
so go ahead and

0:15:57.060,0:16:01.660
take a peek here so we're now in private
research tools

0:16:01.660,0:16:03.910
ls there's all of our stuff

0:16:03.910,0:16:09.190
we can say is g dash dash help hands
take a peek pat

0:16:09.190,0:16:11.270
going on

0:16:11.270,0:16:18.060
i think that's a lot so we could see
some more

0:16:18.060,0:16:22.060
and they'll tell you a little bit about
uh... mercurial setup that will give you

0:16:22.060,0:16:24.890
a list of commands you can look through

0:16:24.890,0:16:27.380
what's your read on your own

0:16:27.380,0:16:29.770
there's a lot to material so

0:16:29.770,0:16:33.210
uh... take a peek through there and
difficult to read

0:16:33.210,0:16:34.780
and the first thing you can do

0:16:34.780,0:16:37.140
instigated age she logged

0:16:37.140,0:16:40.810
and type that's a lesson this is a list
of changes that have happened to in this

0:16:40.810,0:16:43.430
particular repository

0:16:43.430,0:16:47.290
very similar that change that thing we
saw before with a little graph of green

0:16:47.290,0:16:48.720
on the left

0:16:48.720,0:16:51.730
and here it tells you attacks
description that

0:16:51.730,0:16:53.900
the person committed typed in

0:16:53.900,0:16:56.270
and you can see that you know i've

0:16:56.270,0:16:57.860
britt made changes to things

0:16:57.860,0:17:02.530
and it shows you what's going on

0:17:02.530,0:17:05.049
so a lot going on in there

0:17:05.049,0:17:12.049
that was in my research tools that i've
checked out

0:17:13.150,0:17:15.549
into do you think you are a lot with
fast

0:17:15.549,0:17:19.700
so you can take a peek to various things
hands

0:17:19.700,0:17:21.929
will get more into it as we work with

0:17:21.929,0:17:25.189
an actual depository but you can then
take a peek at what's in those

0:17:25.189,0:17:27.900
things and we can also say

0:17:27.900,0:17:33.150
if we say going to to corporate relook
at it as the file it is a hasty vlog

0:17:33.150,0:17:35.260
make file

0:17:35.260,0:17:36.279
pipelines

0:17:36.279,0:17:40.250
no we did before she say she lol will
give us the log of every possible change

0:17:40.250,0:17:41.880
for all files

0:17:41.880,0:17:43.480
place a particular file

0:17:43.480,0:17:46.590
will now be looking at the changes just
for that one particular files you can

0:17:46.590,0:17:49.760
see with this particular make file have
only made one change

0:17:49.760,0:17:50.549
it's just

0:17:50.549,0:17:54.140
wasn't it

0:17:54.140,0:17:57.360
right so let's wish or even more
interesting because you probably want to

0:17:57.360,0:18:00.590
make your own repository and work with
it

0:18:00.590,0:18:05.050
so let's go ahead and create a new
material repository for rico

0:18:05.050,0:18:08.890
as are often called since he vetoes
slash projects

0:18:08.890,0:18:10.200
he ended now

0:18:10.200,0:18:15.280
police say issue status anniversary
without amateur oppose a torrent

0:18:15.280,0:18:16.010
she says

0:18:16.010,0:18:19.429
i don't know which talking about this is
an repository so

0:18:19.429,0:18:21.630
i'm confused

0:18:21.630,0:18:26.150
we can then do is we can say at least
units to create a repository

0:18:26.150,0:18:28.360
and we can say dash dash help

0:18:28.360,0:18:29.769
type that's a lots

0:18:29.769,0:18:34.549
and that'll give us a chance to take a
peek at help for amit animals show is

0:18:34.549,0:18:36.000
there some options

0:18:36.000,0:18:38.630
analyst you've read through that on your
own

0:18:38.630,0:18:42.360
now we're gonna wanna create went
through the cname slowest unit

0:18:42.360,0:18:44.980
and then will say

0:18:44.980,0:18:49.580
uh... and it could work all the parties
students for research tools students

0:18:49.580,0:18:50.300
where you might

0:18:50.300,0:18:51.100
be doing here

0:18:51.100,0:18:54.110
work for costs

0:18:54.110,0:18:56.220
and then we'll hit concert

0:18:56.220,0:18:59.220
and it works really quick because now
i'm doing a whole lot of this then sets

0:18:59.220,0:19:00.040
up

0:19:00.040,0:19:04.140
that will have a new directory called
party students right here

0:19:04.140,0:19:09.750
so we can see the into r_t_e_ student

0:19:09.750,0:19:10.790
and

0:19:10.790,0:19:13.750
then we can say issue status

0:19:13.750,0:19:17.400
uh... nothing's going on here so not
much is two-seat

0:19:17.400,0:19:19.809
and we can say steve martin

0:19:19.809,0:19:24.410
and there is nothing analog because we
haven't had any files so let's go ahead

0:19:24.410,0:19:28.020
and out our first file into our mercure
houses for it

0:19:28.020,0:19:29.840
tutsi issue g

0:19:29.840,0:19:32.490
initiative or we can take action

0:19:32.490,0:19:36.980
remi dot t_ exterior ever touch if the
file doesn't exist for the screen empty

0:19:36.980,0:19:38.179
file

0:19:38.179,0:19:39.550
with that name

0:19:39.550,0:19:41.419
so ls dash o

0:19:41.419,0:19:43.790
we now have an empty like westphal

0:19:43.790,0:19:45.620
city she status

0:19:45.620,0:19:46.789
can't

0:19:46.789,0:19:48.100
pick a real then says

0:19:48.100,0:19:51.270
there is a following our repository if
we don't know anything about that's

0:19:51.270,0:19:53.720
gonna put a question mark on the left to
say

0:19:53.720,0:19:56.200
i don't understand what this file is

0:19:56.200,0:20:00.950
i don't have any information on it

0:20:00.950,0:20:03.510
so let's go ahead hands

0:20:03.510,0:20:07.429
uh... i'm in a quick to do something
that i forgot to do

0:20:07.429,0:20:14.429
collection of before starting this

0:20:14.720,0:20:16.150
sorry about that

0:20:16.150,0:20:19.830
okay soon our set up to go ahead and
give a try to you

0:20:19.830,0:20:23.380
adding that violent material so it's a
if she

0:20:23.380,0:20:24.190
pad

0:20:24.190,0:20:25.940
read me dot taxed

0:20:25.940,0:20:27.820
so what this does says

0:20:27.820,0:20:31.140
i'm going to add this file into the
repository

0:20:31.140,0:20:32.210
so

0:20:32.210,0:20:35.539
now actually hasn't done a whole lot yet
so please save

0:20:35.539,0:20:37.990
packaged g status

0:20:37.990,0:20:43.940
we have and pay after recovery here it
says it's ready to be added in

0:20:43.940,0:20:45.510
he and that's now

0:20:45.510,0:20:47.270
brady go four

0:20:47.270,0:20:50.899
being committed into this repository
locally so let's go ahead and do that's

0:20:50.899,0:20:53.570
will say hey she commits

0:20:53.570,0:20:56.750
and then we give it a message anything
about messages this is what goes in

0:20:56.750,0:20:57.200
there

0:20:57.200,0:20:58.860
the log file

0:20:58.860,0:21:02.440
novel filed at the log it goes with the
file

0:21:02.440,0:21:05.120
so this is the kind of inflation tells a
person

0:21:05.120,0:21:08.380
further overview summary of what the
changes are

0:21:08.380,0:21:11.960
and it's a real arctic reading could log
files

0:21:11.960,0:21:14.769
it's a full-scale that's many people had
to

0:21:14.769,0:21:16.440
worked very hard to develop

0:21:16.440,0:21:18.010
patented

0:21:18.010,0:21:19.020
comments

0:21:19.020,0:21:21.310
and uh... i can tell you first

0:21:21.310,0:21:25.660
for certain that if you're a couple page
essay in the long comment people just

0:21:25.660,0:21:28.660
get first-rate with you but if you don't
get enough information also be

0:21:28.660,0:21:30.440
frustrated

0:21:30.440,0:21:34.410
so hein courage you to talk to the
people and see what makes for a good or

0:21:34.410,0:21:36.230
bad blog entry

0:21:36.230,0:21:37.950
tool sort of saying empty

0:21:37.950,0:21:40.700
file to you start

0:21:40.700,0:21:42.130
project

0:21:42.130,0:21:45.890
and if we don't specify a file name it
will commit anything that's really be

0:21:45.890,0:21:47.430
committed

0:21:47.430,0:21:49.179
so if we get cancer

0:21:49.179,0:21:51.200
uh... what we have a problem

0:21:51.200,0:21:56.120
we actually need to specify the username
that will be associated with that's

0:21:56.120,0:21:57.180
commit

0:21:57.180,0:21:59.740
and we do that is we need to add

0:21:59.740,0:22:01.800
uh... some configuration information

0:22:01.800,0:22:03.770
fifty issue help

0:22:03.770,0:22:07.360
config type laughs

0:22:07.360,0:22:11.370
and this gives you information on how to
configure mercurial

0:22:11.370,0:22:13.330
and what will need to do is actually

0:22:13.330,0:22:17.399

we're now back at our committee

0:23:51.530,0:23:53.649
we can press center

0:23:53.649,0:23:57.170
and are changes were committed make it
to you

0:23:57.170,0:23:59.500
that this was change zero

0:24:25.010,0:24:28.029

0:24:28.799,0:24:31.610
when it was done which files changed

0:24:31.610,0:24:35.100
and here is our log message right here

0:24:35.100,0:24:36.980
that were pretty well

0:24:36.980,0:24:42.250

heard say that control x control s

0:25:22.640,0:25:26.470
this is in a very good reading papers
trying to be quick and show the basic

0:25:26.470,0:25:27.640
concept

0:25:27.640,0:25:32.940
so let's take a look pat's material
striking a balance within six g status

0:25:32.940,0:25:34.080
and if we

0:25:34.080,0:25:39.120
look here we see nam for modifying
harini dot t_ exp

0:25:39.120,0:25:43.070
and the great part about materials now
it knows about our last version

0:25:43.070,0:25:46.830
and if you look at our current file
intel's was different

0:25:46.830,0:25:48.220
this is called a difference

0:25:48.220,0:25:50.530
and that's pretty done with the deaf

0:25:50.530,0:25:52.240
emancipation g

0:25:52.240,0:25:55.900
tiff if you don't specify a file name it
will look for any follows different and

0:25:55.900,0:25:57.570
show you that

0:25:57.570,0:26:00.590
so if you have a lot going on you do you
want to specify the pounding on the way

0:26:00.590,0:26:03.920
so get clobbered with tons of
information

0:26:03.920,0:26:06.660
sonar kesar diff is actually pretty
small

0:26:06.660,0:26:08.970
so here it is it says

0:26:08.970,0:26:11.000
here's uh... file we started with

0:26:11.000,0:26:15.570
and with the dayton time here's the file
we have now date and time

0:26:15.570,0:26:17.160
or just a couple minutes later

0:26:17.160,0:26:17.980
and

0:26:17.980,0:26:20.830
it said that we've added to lawrence

0:26:20.830,0:26:23.220
that's great so now we can

0:26:23.220,0:26:25.360
they could change that he's g

0:26:25.360,0:26:27.740
mentor teams and so if you commit

0:26:27.740,0:26:29.590
professor pam

0:26:29.590,0:26:32.840
here's our message to intro lines with

0:26:32.840,0:26:34.309
basic

0:26:34.309,0:26:36.250
t_v_ scription

0:26:36.250,0:26:38.260
presenters should commit it

0:26:38.260,0:26:42.090
so now we made our change that's our
second one an accounting firm zero

0:26:42.090,0:26:44.830
because were computer science types here

0:26:44.830,0:26:48.670
so one

0:26:48.670,0:26:52.140
and we can say h_g_ log

0:26:52.140,0:26:55.060
on

0:26:55.060,0:26:55.990
reading

0:26:55.990,0:26:59.740
or we can actually says five files will
do it with the fire

0:26:59.740,0:27:01.940
and yes it is now two changes here

0:27:01.940,0:27:04.110
to here's our first change

0:27:04.110,0:27:07.460
and if we throw back a little bit here's
our second chance

0:27:07.460,0:27:10.179
with her masters

0:27:10.179,0:27:11.570
that's pretty nice

0:27:11.570,0:27:13.880
now let's make a third one

0:27:13.880,0:27:20.480
and on the site in the final salute kurt

0:27:23.620,0:27:26.260
control x control s

0:27:26.260,0:27:28.110
and we can now

0:27:28.110,0:27:29.270
commit that

0:27:29.270,0:27:31.650

0:27:31.650,0:27:36.110
commit message spot in the file

0:27:36.110,0:27:40.059
so we've now got

0:27:40.059,0:27:43.380
she status

0:27:43.380,0:27:47.660
um... so now we have three changes in
their can we can go start looking at our

0:27:47.660,0:27:50.060
older changes and see what they're like

0:27:50.060,0:27:52.870
sould take a look

0:27:52.870,0:27:55.370
house control x_y_ and to you

0:27:55.370,0:27:58.800
discover one buffered control exposed me
to the opposite

0:27:58.800,0:28:03.610
preferred suppressed have almost
extended

0:28:03.610,0:28:04.440
ball

0:28:04.440,0:28:09.140
cv where did their tools to animate
projects

0:28:09.140,0:28:11.179
parties didn't

0:28:11.179,0:28:12.850
tasty log

0:28:12.850,0:28:15.419
we'll see our log of all the changes

0:28:15.419,0:28:18.450
now you probably want to take that
celeste in the future

0:28:18.450,0:28:20.370
so if she'd want less

0:28:20.370,0:28:22.710
because there may be quite a few

0:28:22.710,0:28:26.590
now we can look at the acidic log
entries in the final so we can see each

0:28:26.590,0:28:28.530
g

0:28:28.530,0:28:32.410
cap very much like the units coming and
then we can specify a revision for final

0:28:32.410,0:28:34.140
so

0:28:34.140,0:28:36.039
revision zero

0:28:36.039,0:28:40.669
theaters first formal misfiring and it
should show us the initial file which

0:28:40.669,0:28:43.570
was empty and in fact it was empty

0:28:43.570,0:28:47.300
now we can say pat

0:28:47.300,0:28:50.550
and root of all that revision
information fml shows the current

0:28:50.550,0:28:54.660
version file sloth beginning in the end
of what's going on right now

0:28:54.660,0:28:59.670
telecaster versions in between so he's
cheat at dash dash revision

0:28:59.670,0:29:02.190
one after read me dot text

0:29:02.190,0:29:05.640
and that shows you are for first

0:29:05.640,0:29:07.700
second provisional or one

0:29:07.700,0:29:09.400
uh... format file

0:29:09.400,0:29:13.060
and we can also ask for revision number
two

0:29:13.060,0:29:14.770
you'll see that version here

0:29:14.770,0:29:18.590
so you always have access to every
change without you've got even if you

0:29:18.590,0:29:23.910
delete that file from material people
have a laugh island all history of it

0:29:23.910,0:29:28.140
so that's the power of revision control
systems that you have this ability to

0:29:28.140,0:29:30.320
look back into your files

0:29:30.320,0:29:32.840
even when you've left aversion behind us
in the needed

0:29:32.840,0:29:34.500
in a month three years ago

0:29:34.500,0:29:37.810
and be able to see what's changed and
why because you have the logs and you

0:29:37.810,0:29:39.350
have the differences

0:29:39.350,0:29:43.980
so how to look at the difference between
two versions we can say he she deaf

0:29:43.980,0:29:48.380
and that'll give us the changes require
more info which also say dash are for

0:29:48.380,0:29:49.680
her vision

0:29:49.680,0:29:52.200
and we'll compare revisions one and two

0:29:52.200,0:29:53.980
for remi

0:29:53.980,0:29:57.510
system and will show us the difference
between revisions one and two

0:29:57.510,0:30:01.600
and they can see that we had a point
point endorsing tour

0:30:01.600,0:30:02.279
so thats

0:30:02.279,0:30:04.830
really powerful tool to be able to look
into

0:30:04.830,0:30:09.780
york odan

0:30:09.780,0:30:15.250
let's try out some of the functionality
if we delete a file

0:30:15.250,0:30:17.390
so if we say

0:30:17.390,0:30:18.240
r_e_m_

0:30:18.240,0:30:20.370
read me dot texte

0:30:20.370,0:30:23.480
presenter sister it

0:30:23.480,0:30:24.440
groups weight

0:30:24.440,0:30:27.300
we actually want that file back

0:30:27.300,0:30:29.610
with a she's palace and see that

0:30:29.610,0:30:33.160
yes mission point says oh my goodness
the files gone

0:30:33.160,0:30:36.820
it knows about the review presence in
your current directory

0:30:36.820,0:30:38.700
so we can say is cheap

0:30:38.700,0:30:41.520
revert

0:30:41.520,0:30:43.620
remi dot t_ exp

0:30:43.620,0:30:44.649
and

0:30:44.649,0:30:50.200
it says it's comforting it we can take a
look here and our review file his back

0:30:50.200,0:30:54.340
preemie dot t_ if he saw a fantastic if
you are filling with the file

0:30:54.340,0:30:57.450
don't like what you've done to make
himself turned around

0:30:57.450,0:31:01.250
as you try and get complex coating for
example you can just with the final and

0:31:01.250,0:31:05.610
say revert me back to where you worked
nothing he wished he status

0:31:05.610,0:31:08.750
everything is good there's no changes

0:31:08.750,0:31:10.190
very powerful

0:31:10.190,0:31:15.679
alright so what makes the material treat
sevilla constrict realistic chelate

0:31:15.679,0:31:19.200
we have a dot htm correct resurgence
uh...

0:31:19.200,0:31:21.279
now especially

0:31:21.279,0:31:27.270
uh... that's truce and we can then say
do you dot h_g_ see what's in there

0:31:27.270,0:31:29.820
and there's a couple different
directories speaking to an analyst at

0:31:29.820,0:31:32.029
shell dot g

0:31:32.029,0:31:36.279
as the materials that this directory out
things changing tracking what's going on

0:31:36.279,0:31:37.390
directory

0:31:37.390,0:31:42.210
so don't fill with p dot h two drudgery
only got to stay in their if you decide

0:31:42.210,0:31:45.950
that you don't want to be materially
track anymore you can always point that

0:31:45.950,0:31:49.060
but i recommend being very careful about
that

0:31:49.060,0:31:52.000
so how do we have directories

0:31:52.000,0:31:53.980
week a m

0:31:53.980,0:32:00.080
uh... do you make your dash keys to the
supreme multiple directories zero one

0:32:00.080,0:32:01.750
increase here too

0:32:01.750,0:32:06.460
and we can be something recreate hold on
to the same time zone three four five

0:32:06.460,0:32:07.910
six

0:32:07.910,0:32:09.059
presenter

0:32:09.059,0:32:10.460
and then

0:32:10.460,0:32:12.840
we now have

0:32:12.840,0:32:16.150
publisher directories alistair show
clocks

0:32:16.150,0:32:19.190
that's correct we can now say he she had

0:32:19.190,0:32:20.669
klaus

0:32:20.669,0:32:22.120
presenter

0:32:22.120,0:32:25.000
if she's status

0:32:25.000,0:32:30.429
we now have which stuff we can see each
g

0:32:30.429,0:32:34.710
connect clients

0:32:34.710,0:32:38.160
and apparently continued we do it so it
should be

0:32:38.160,0:32:40.649
had constants in seemed to

0:32:40.649,0:32:43.970
tinting unless you have files in there

0:32:43.970,0:32:47.679
and again and pretty near record so
we'll just go on from there

0:32:47.679,0:32:51.580
and i'll figure and directories later on
i'll post a video

0:32:51.580,0:32:56.270
let's take a look at working with imax

0:32:56.270,0:32:57.490
there's a key

0:32:57.490,0:33:03.659
we need to know if the vision control
nuts control acts d and d that's victor

0:33:03.659,0:33:04.720
using the term

0:33:04.720,0:33:06.640
and so

0:33:06.640,0:33:09.080
if we're now on our renamed

0:33:09.080,0:33:12.570
can also say another

0:33:12.570,0:33:14.730
file dot t_ xti

0:33:14.730,0:33:16.580
and if you look here

0:33:16.580,0:33:19.720
had gone he she and the version number

0:33:19.720,0:33:24.370
i'm showing you be in command of that
particular file and this one shows no

0:33:24.370,0:33:28.799
material information so he filed for

0:33:28.799,0:33:31.580
correa or you know something like that
person

0:33:31.580,0:33:32.840
some text

0:33:32.840,0:33:36.700
if we want to and that file and control
xvi fee

0:33:36.700,0:33:37.960
is indeed

0:33:37.960,0:33:41.730
material arrogant version control next
command

0:33:41.730,0:33:47.770
and it always stressed to ask you save
file feet modified its will say yes

0:33:47.770,0:33:52.410
if you get a file isn't connor version
control register that file

0:33:52.410,0:33:57.250
you're not gonna curls retreats going to
go back to the old or so yes way

0:33:57.250,0:33:59.609
to make sure he remembered colonels
retreat

0:33:59.609,0:34:03.670
and now control x dv will check in those
changes

0:34:03.670,0:34:04.930
tools say

0:34:04.930,0:34:05.699
and

0:34:05.699,0:34:07.060
commercial

0:34:07.060,0:34:09.979
file to demonstrates

0:34:09.979,0:34:15.639
he max control c control c says were
down in their control c control seat

0:34:15.639,0:34:17.179
it's not checked in

0:34:17.179,0:34:21.240
and who are making a change we can say
another change

0:34:21.240,0:34:24.219
control xa defeat

0:34:24.219,0:34:28.529
files of state control x controller save
that control x dvd

0:34:28.529,0:34:30.980
and now realizes there's something
different

0:34:30.980,0:34:33.939
and we can say eight-second

0:34:33.939,0:34:36.459
changed for impacts

0:34:36.459,0:34:39.819
control c control c clothes that up

0:34:39.819,0:34:43.419
and we now have looked at

0:34:43.419,0:34:47.059
the material changes to control xvi

0:34:47.059,0:34:49.979
let's go take a look at some of the
twins really quick

0:34:49.979,0:34:52.839
we have

0:34:52.839,0:34:58.549
uh... i'm going to put my window here
sort of control x five two

0:34:58.549,0:35:03.579
so now we have to be next but first a
contract things

0:35:03.579,0:35:08.449
angels around really fast

0:35:08.449,0:35:10.579
in thus far we can say

0:35:10.579,0:35:13.599
uh... control acts v

0:35:13.599,0:35:15.270
control acts the

0:35:15.270,0:35:16.080
at all

0:35:16.080,0:35:19.510
analysts the history for that particular
finals if you're interested in what's

0:35:19.510,0:35:21.299
going on

0:35:21.299,0:35:25.879
if we've modified stuff so modifications

0:35:25.879,0:35:29.939
let's cut through stricken

0:35:29.939,0:35:32.390
modified

0:35:32.390,0:35:34.459
say that and we can say

0:35:34.459,0:35:36.619
control x v

0:35:36.619,0:35:37.590
equals

0:35:37.590,0:35:42.910
and it doesn't have to see what's going
on you can then take a look at changes

0:35:42.910,0:35:45.889
and if you want to see an old version
you can do

0:35:45.889,0:35:47.889
control except v

0:35:47.889,0:35:54.409
filled up can we can say zero prenatal
version or maybe one

0:35:54.409,0:35:58.269
uh... maybe once you've got here

0:35:58.269,0:36:02.429
control just a quick relaxed beats
restrictions flogged

0:36:02.429,0:36:06.849
editions fortune shift resourceful
kitchen set three

0:36:06.849,0:36:10.320
so to control acts v

0:36:10.320,0:36:13.559
filled up and will say three presenter

0:36:13.559,0:36:15.459
ended now shows you

0:36:15.459,0:36:18.069
what was that version three

0:36:18.069,0:36:22.929
so that's out pretty powerful paint will
talk more about material teacher videos

0:36:22.929,0:36:27.690
where we can talk about pushing up to
uh... remote location and contains going

0:36:27.690,0:36:31.920
but that's it for now thank you for
joining paint happy version control
