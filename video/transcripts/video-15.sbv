welcome to research tools video fifteen
my name is kurt square and in the studio

0:00:06.640,0:00:10.980
this is python part eight i'll be
talking about map auckland

0:00:10.980,0:00:13.350
and hopefully this is part one of
several

0:00:13.350,0:00:17.220
practice episodes uh... mclaughlin

0:00:17.220,0:00:20.470
now let's take you through some basics
of

0:00:20.470,0:00:23.130
general graphing applauding impact on

0:00:23.130,0:00:27.589
now my background is with kidney plot
named what a great tooled

0:00:27.589,0:00:30.759
i find it kind of limiting and
frustrating and that doesn't have a full

0:00:30.759,0:00:35.410
programming language to go with it and
isn't quite as flexible as mcfarlane

0:00:35.410,0:00:40.160
so you'll be following along with the as
i learn some of the basics of my popcorn

0:00:40.160,0:00:44.290
phyllis jump into with seventy p s data
collected from

0:00:44.290,0:00:47.560
the center for coastal ocean mapping
photographic center from the roof are

0:00:47.560,0:00:48.610
building

0:00:48.610,0:00:49.399
we have

0:00:49.399,0:00:52.510
and earmarked g_p_s_ and weather station

0:00:52.510,0:00:55.380
it's typically used on the ship them out
on our route

0:00:55.380,0:00:57.700
so go ahead and copy the

0:00:57.700,0:01:02.280
data that i prepared it not gone ahead
and a creeper status

0:01:02.280,0:01:04.210
so that we don't have to you

0:01:04.210,0:01:08.009
go through all the basics of being a
person who recovered and produce videos

0:01:08.009,0:01:10.840
so for those see videos

0:01:10.840,0:01:12.700
twelve thirteen fourteen

0:01:12.700,0:01:17.530
so go ahead and make a directory for our
video fifteen class of

0:01:17.530,0:01:18.829
you fifteen

0:01:18.829,0:01:20.740
we zip dash key

0:01:20.740,0:01:23.710
to do multiple directories

0:01:23.710,0:01:26.850
and we'll go ahead and cd and to video

0:01:26.850,0:01:29.369
fifteen

0:01:29.369,0:01:33.830
and go ahead and w get that phylum

0:01:33.830,0:01:36.360
please the mouse to place that and

0:01:36.360,0:01:39.410
answer what did he get programmer data

0:01:39.410,0:01:44.460
in the first thing to notices that we
are not going to uncompressed this file

0:01:44.460,0:01:48.509
we're going to be working with tools in
high python empire lab

0:01:48.509,0:01:52.659
there's actual called uh... low-tax
ticket number five that's actually knows

0:01:52.659,0:01:55.860
how to read compressed data without
suppressing it

0:01:55.860,0:01:57.780
on the desk first

0:01:57.780,0:02:01.189
let's take a look at our data to prove
garb we can you filed two thousand

0:02:01.189,0:02:03.660
eleven pam

0:02:03.660,0:02:06.520
and that just tells us that we have some
compressed data

0:02:06.520,0:02:10.279
we can do a bs detach two thousand levin

0:02:10.279,0:02:13.079
and the first to know typically do you
expect that to last because if it's

0:02:13.079,0:02:16.920
crazy binary data less is pretty good at
protecting us from

0:02:16.920,0:02:20.839
expert having our transfer dept so press
return

0:02:20.839,0:02:24.730
ames lo and behold we have seventy here

0:02:24.730,0:02:25.940
so we'll go ahead

0:02:25.940,0:02:30.089
use q too quick i have lots of pain will
take a peek at

0:02:30.089,0:02:33.749
battle by using heads instead so apparel

0:02:33.749,0:02:37.949
go back and replaced last with hadn't

0:02:37.949,0:02:39.249
in our final

0:02:39.249,0:02:43.419
a typical comic convention is to use
that pound or hash character from the

0:02:43.419,0:02:45.159
first character of the line

0:02:45.159,0:02:48.309
to indicate that this is comments

0:02:48.309,0:02:53.809
not use that here in a britain in some
identifiers for the columns in our data

0:02:53.809,0:03:00.809
brenda have acts or longitude first
blind promoting z for all students

0:03:00.810,0:03:03.059
with positive upbeat the wash up with

0:03:03.059,0:03:06.099
paraded sometimes positive is down which
is

0:03:06.099,0:03:07.389
no fun

0:03:07.389,0:03:08.990
equality factor

0:03:08.990,0:03:14.370
and number of satellites and horizontal
pollution uh... precision we're going to

0:03:14.370,0:03:17.569
ignore a lot of three and just work
today

0:03:17.569,0:03:19.370
with acts in life

0:03:19.370,0:03:24.639
and i think will probably keeping ignore
are prosecutors eat

0:03:24.639,0:03:28.439
so it looks pretty good will go ahead
and start are high-priced on so we can

0:03:28.439,0:03:33.619
start taking a peek at the database will
say hi python dash dash pile avid and

0:03:33.619,0:03:35.460
that will turn on the

0:03:35.460,0:03:37.989
plotting mode in this is a convenience

0:03:37.989,0:03:38.950
option

0:03:38.950,0:03:43.579
imports all kinds of models integer
default called namespace

0:03:43.579,0:03:45.780
and that way we don't have to be typing

0:03:45.780,0:03:49.689
number hyd dot something rather or

0:03:49.689,0:03:53.699
digging into side timeout followed we
thank you

0:03:53.699,0:03:55.569
go ahead and start that up

0:03:55.569,0:03:57.250
chemotherapy dvd

0:03:57.250,0:04:01.220
so if you are overdue accounts to see
what's in our directory so it's pretty

0:04:01.220,0:04:02.699
good

0:04:02.699,0:04:03.840
things go ahead

0:04:03.840,0:04:04.989
end

0:04:04.989,0:04:10.589
try loading party down emory musicman
called load tfc so we can devote e x t

0:04:10.589,0:04:12.119
question mark

0:04:12.119,0:04:14.689
press in terms of it does help

0:04:14.689,0:04:17.269
victory upon this function a little bit

0:04:17.269,0:04:18.700
kingston notice

0:04:18.700,0:04:23.910
in the file petitions tells us where
aunt it's grabbing this module from and

0:04:23.910,0:04:25.629
we can see that it's

0:04:25.629,0:04:28.519
how dysfunctional attacks came out of

0:04:28.519,0:04:30.249
umpire live

0:04:30.249,0:04:31.620
antony and people

0:04:31.620,0:04:33.330
why idle

0:04:33.330,0:04:38.340
what we really care about his num time
so later on when we

0:04:38.340,0:04:42.969
right at this code is on file it we can
reuse we're gonna have to import this

0:04:42.969,0:04:44.250
non-party

0:04:44.250,0:04:47.879
and get it back in because we won't be
using their dash dash number high with a

0:04:47.879,0:04:51.479
national model it only applies to be
item child

0:04:51.479,0:04:52.449
so stupid

0:04:52.449,0:04:54.919
tickets in the options for a low-tax

0:04:54.919,0:04:57.810
we've got our file named after him

0:04:57.810,0:05:00.889
are tight is going to be a fluke which
should work just fine for instance

0:05:00.889,0:05:04.729
defaults to you have in common start
with a patent that's great delimiter

0:05:04.729,0:05:08.279
none means white space was hipolito

0:05:08.279,0:05:13.229
and so it looks like from the fall are
pretty close to kids here the main is

0:05:13.229,0:05:16.939
showing us that if we have a dodgy
easier dot be easy to u file we don't

0:05:16.939,0:05:19.609
have to worry about a particular forrest

0:05:19.609,0:05:20.329
detect

0:05:20.329,0:05:24.919
talks about the datatype for where it's
going to create memory

0:05:24.919,0:05:27.740
comments to letters

0:05:27.740,0:05:29.910
pollack's pretty good and

0:05:29.910,0:05:34.439
and a little bit will probably come back
and take a look at compaq

0:05:34.439,0:05:37.699
let's go ahead and make you a quick end
of the teacher

0:05:37.699,0:05:41.699
includes load up some data so dat equals
low

0:05:41.699,0:05:44.139
t x t

0:05:44.139,0:05:47.550
and then and a single quote and i'm
gonna start typing the findings thirty

0:05:47.550,0:05:51.239
zero on one and a compressed tab to
complete that

0:05:51.239,0:05:55.419
remember that the tab completion tends
to look at the context of where you are

0:05:55.419,0:06:00.179
tries his best to cast to see if there's
an auction intended use

0:06:00.179,0:06:04.159
pressed enter ambitious load in a
separate jim

0:06:04.159,0:06:08.380
and then we can ask it

0:06:08.380,0:06:12.360
now our data is a type num high andy
array

0:06:12.360,0:06:16.379
we don't need to really know much about
this uh... then it's a career list like

0:06:16.379,0:06:17.850
object

0:06:17.850,0:06:18.910
but it's actually a

0:06:18.910,0:06:22.449
very specialized in fast representation
of data

0:06:22.449,0:06:24.870
it's a with all the data structure

0:06:24.870,0:06:26.729
as designed to be speedy

0:06:26.729,0:06:30.400
and were quite well with america
processing

0:06:30.400,0:06:34.310
we take a quick peek at by starting off
by saying the length of data to we've

0:06:34.310,0:06:35.219
got

0:06:35.219,0:06:40.400
and we have eighty six thousand wines
and stack are filed in situ will use the

0:06:40.400,0:06:43.489
bank to run outback shelf in the end

0:06:43.489,0:06:45.970
inside a pipette on and so will say

0:06:45.970,0:06:48.639
would be easy cat

0:06:48.639,0:06:50.449
notepad didn't work for me

0:06:50.449,0:06:52.870
because were inside of uh...

0:06:52.870,0:06:56.680
animal fat eleven did know how to
complete

0:06:56.680,0:06:57.590
the

0:06:57.590,0:06:58.689
file name

0:06:58.689,0:07:03.439
luna park dot t_ debbie c which is
wordcount and forget is that shelton the

0:07:03.439,0:07:05.960
in the company winds

0:07:05.960,0:07:10.669
and so you can see here at that we are
having just a difference of one in the

0:07:10.669,0:07:12.430
length and that comes from

0:07:12.430,0:07:16.080
the comment line being counted with the
word count but not in the length of our

0:07:16.080,0:07:17.929
david got

0:07:17.929,0:07:23.449
so let's take a look at one and three of
our data sources say dataset zero

0:07:23.449,0:07:25.799
and what we've got is

0:07:25.799,0:07:27.780
in the first entry of the array

0:07:27.780,0:07:31.739
is the list margin of error rate they
work the same

0:07:31.739,0:07:36.229
and it contains one record from the
g_p_s_ here we have our longitude are

0:07:36.229,0:07:38.939
latitude are altitude

0:07:38.939,0:07:40.330
equality factor

0:07:40.330,0:07:42.319
and our other two parameters

0:07:42.319,0:07:46.699
not quite what we want we actually wanna
an array of artists is an array for

0:07:46.699,0:07:50.099
wisely compile-time against each other

0:07:50.099,0:07:53.729
so we need to get me to uh... look at
that a little bit different but before

0:07:53.729,0:07:55.249
we do that

0:07:55.249,0:07:58.659
person who is this is really big if we
load too much stuff in a memory we may

0:07:58.659,0:08:02.129
end up going so later on for the show
you how to get rid of something from

0:08:02.129,0:08:03.889
your workspace

0:08:03.889,0:08:06.009
so we can say

0:08:06.009,0:08:10.539
whose canal telus what's in our states
and we have our daily here that we don't

0:08:10.539,0:08:16.079
want to keep around anymore so we can
just say delete

0:08:16.079,0:08:18.110
had enter

0:08:18.110,0:08:19.680
and then protect whose

0:08:19.680,0:08:21.969
there's uh... nothing left back in there

0:08:21.969,0:08:22.809
now this

0:08:22.809,0:08:26.219
unique locally it doesn't matter
guarantee that memories been freed up

0:08:26.219,0:08:29.889
but let's put on at any point later on
the road to a smoker box collection and

0:08:29.889,0:08:32.800
grab her activities

0:08:32.800,0:08:38.140
let's let's go ahead in look again at
lewd tfc with question marks that

0:08:38.140,0:08:39.640
somehow put

0:08:39.640,0:08:40.850
payens

0:08:40.850,0:08:45.510
there's this unpack option which sounds
like it might do if we want source could

0:08:45.510,0:08:46.570
down there

0:08:46.570,0:08:48.500
space to get down the page

0:08:48.500,0:08:50.850
duplicate unpacked

0:08:50.850,0:08:54.970
actually does exactly what we want to
eat crabs out each other

0:08:54.970,0:08:59.880
the vertical columns of data into a
separate herbal and python has a

0:08:59.880,0:09:04.029
style of writing variables we can say
several of the rebels equals

0:09:04.029,0:09:05.280
and then something

0:09:05.280,0:09:09.060
animal split apart each of those burke
very nicely for so let's go ahead and

0:09:09.060,0:09:10.870
try it out

0:09:10.870,0:09:14.600
sourcesafe ex-con wired com lindsay

0:09:14.600,0:09:17.360
and then comma wallet p

0:09:17.360,0:09:20.130
satellite

0:09:20.130,0:09:21.770
peach top

0:09:21.770,0:09:23.120
equals

0:09:23.120,0:09:24.530
lo ti exceed

0:09:24.530,0:09:26.300
women are followed

0:09:26.300,0:09:30.190
but now we're gonna say an extra option
and in a cucumber water so we don't have

0:09:30.190,0:09:33.160
to deal with wrapping meal confusing

0:09:33.160,0:09:34.650
mistaken

0:09:34.650,0:09:38.440
pack equals troop

0:09:38.440,0:09:40.360
hit enter

0:09:40.360,0:09:43.370
and it looked a little bit fastest time

0:09:43.370,0:09:47.449
because of uh... when she would do
through intensive sitkinak operations

0:09:47.449,0:09:49.780
compassionate faster

0:09:49.780,0:09:51.400
but we can say type

0:09:51.400,0:09:52.520
acts

0:09:52.520,0:09:54.160
it's still unemployed

0:09:54.160,0:09:56.610
india ray but we can say

0:09:56.610,0:09:58.170
point texts

0:09:58.170,0:10:01.040
off the same length but if we say you

0:10:01.040,0:10:06.220
act sub-zero we get back just one
escorted we just have to hit enter

0:10:06.220,0:10:08.159
will see that it is an array

0:10:08.159,0:10:10.890
consisting of just are longitude

0:10:10.890,0:10:14.110
and why history of our latitudes

0:10:14.110,0:10:15.510
now being the bears

0:10:15.510,0:10:18.910
over eighty thousand points we're not
going to go look at that so it's best to

0:10:18.910,0:10:24.290
use papon to try and get a sense of what
indicating so we can say coverage

0:10:24.290,0:10:27.840
ivax this'll compete the average value

0:10:27.840,0:10:31.000
slacks creek looks pretty good looks
like that's right about location in

0:10:31.000,0:10:32.870
seekonk

0:10:32.870,0:10:34.420
in for life

0:10:34.420,0:10:39.780
we have m_s_-forty three point one three
five no that is actually point great on

0:10:39.780,0:10:41.490
top of our building

0:10:41.490,0:10:44.370
right where the devices locates that's
excellence

0:10:44.370,0:10:49.180
note also say what's the range about
twenty min acts

0:10:49.180,0:10:51.580
and max pacs and i will tell us

0:10:51.580,0:10:53.350
how much variation areas

0:10:53.350,0:10:57.830
enforcement this isn't you know you can
really care about this is longitude

0:10:57.830,0:11:01.180
and you probably don't have a good sense
of the difference of those kids who

0:11:01.180,0:11:06.160
perceive max xmas min acts

0:11:06.160,0:11:09.170
we have to thousands of

0:11:09.170,0:11:13.460
longitude material on student and that
number doesn't really mean tunis tunisia

0:11:13.460,0:11:16.160
later on will convert that two meters

0:11:16.160,0:11:18.600
let's go ahead and plot our data and see
what it looks like

0:11:18.600,0:11:20.960
so plot x

0:11:20.960,0:11:24.070
this is our first use of mclaughlin

0:11:24.070,0:11:27.770
and here we have our expiry bowling you
can see the steering looks very random

0:11:27.770,0:11:32.570
back-and-forth throughout the day is
just twenty four hours a g_p_s_ data

0:11:32.570,0:11:36.370
in that is the sense that this is a
really random process there's not some

0:11:36.370,0:11:40.320
sort of strange bias or pattern going on

0:11:40.320,0:11:42.129
and we can also try and plot

0:11:42.129,0:11:43.710
are weidetan

0:11:43.710,0:11:46.260
and to make this a little it's
informants

0:11:46.260,0:11:48.900
and there was some

0:11:48.900,0:11:50.150
plot y

0:11:50.150,0:11:53.090
came to get something that really isn't
what we want

0:11:53.090,0:11:58.420
missus plotting are acts down here an r_
y_ appear on the scene

0:11:58.420,0:12:01.490
graph and that's really not what we want

0:12:01.490,0:12:04.950
so it's learned how to deal with stuff
like that we can split apart and stick

0:12:04.950,0:12:07.830
figure so we can say c l_ a_

0:12:07.830,0:12:09.710
will wipe out what's in

0:12:09.710,0:12:11.080
your particular figure

0:12:11.080,0:12:12.460
this is

0:12:12.460,0:12:14.680
called clear access

0:12:14.680,0:12:17.720
into let's go ahead and plot acts again

0:12:17.720,0:12:19.350
picked up at all setup

0:12:19.350,0:12:24.130
so tennis together and let's go ahead
and plot are y

0:12:24.130,0:12:27.900
but before we do that were not to do
that we're gonna say

0:12:27.900,0:12:30.780
to hurt creek and other figure

0:12:30.780,0:12:36.470
so to fall secret starting off with
figure one and we can make figure to you

0:12:36.470,0:12:39.160
so scheme that move it over

0:12:39.160,0:12:42.410
and i wasn't a plot

0:12:42.410,0:12:43.620
sooner

0:12:43.620,0:12:48.360
and now we have our acts tanner why did
it mechanical saint i'm assuming that he

0:12:48.360,0:12:51.390
has three big enough to see them

0:12:51.390,0:12:53.040
so it's pretty nice

0:12:53.040,0:12:56.480
combo or would we want to use maybe we
want to see them together plot against

0:12:56.480,0:13:01.030
each other so we can save figure

0:13:01.030,0:13:03.000
and we can say

0:13:03.000,0:13:04.000
uh... wayne

0:13:04.000,0:13:07.400
and we can say plots explained why

0:13:07.400,0:13:11.350
subplots are largely suit against each
other

0:13:11.350,0:13:12.419
remember that

0:13:12.419,0:13:17.650
i tend to do everything ex-con a wired
and that'll be longitude commodity in

0:13:17.650,0:13:19.430
play center

0:13:19.430,0:13:23.410
and read it looks like an ink blot tests
but this shows us that

0:13:23.410,0:13:27.460
we have a pretty good sense of what the
g_p_s_ wonder is it doesn't go heading

0:13:27.460,0:13:29.510
off across the globe

0:13:29.510,0:13:32.730
and this is a lot better than we might
see in

0:13:32.730,0:13:35.680
i data from the sixties and seventies
when satellite navigation was just

0:13:35.680,0:13:39.340
beginning g_p_s_ is actually pretty good
these days

0:13:39.340,0:13:42.020
but it certainly is something like this
you really don't want to start being

0:13:42.020,0:13:45.130
able to label it so let's talk about
labeling

0:13:45.130,0:13:46.560
and setting up

0:13:46.560,0:13:53.160
uh... figures so that you can then later
on saved them pertinent your notes

0:13:53.160,0:13:55.170
filmmakers little smaller

0:13:55.170,0:14:01.810
and let's talk about labeled subtitle is
that twins tomlinson g_p_s_ wonder

0:14:01.810,0:14:03.079
one day

0:14:03.079,0:14:06.150
poetry title but it's did not pronounced

0:14:06.150,0:14:09.310
that the title appear at the top

0:14:09.310,0:14:12.510
recommittal or x-axis so acts

0:14:12.510,0:14:15.520
label

0:14:15.520,0:14:20.240
and we can say launches too

0:14:20.240,0:14:24.720
and what we have a nice along stripping
down there

0:14:24.720,0:14:26.690
mean troops

0:14:26.690,0:14:33.690
well stricken fresh so label while able
paint latitude

0:14:35.160,0:14:38.860
and so there's a lot of people left
considered a little small additional

0:14:38.860,0:14:41.100
taxes

0:14:41.100,0:14:44.999
now if you want to touch back and forth
between all of your figures you can just

0:14:44.999,0:14:48.500
safety gear one and will go back to get
one

0:14:48.500,0:14:51.460
and then we can say title

0:14:51.460,0:14:56.040
and a darker was on figure one i believe
it was textile to say

0:14:56.040,0:14:58.610
x

0:14:58.610,0:15:00.050
expertise

0:15:00.050,0:15:01.630
access

0:15:01.630,0:15:02.570
santer bd

0:15:02.570,0:15:05.330
never go back here in the loop for cnt
figure for me

0:15:05.330,0:15:06.660
and head back

0:15:06.660,0:15:08.870
we have our x-axis

0:15:08.870,0:15:11.970
so it's very nice we've got some basic
figure stuff going

0:15:11.970,0:15:14.980
gina became clear that up and

0:15:14.980,0:15:18.430
get rid of these guys 'cause we just
want to play with

0:15:18.430,0:15:21.770
this one from a good weekend and
penetration to break into the middle of

0:15:21.770,0:15:23.870
figure that's helpful

0:15:23.870,0:15:25.470
and i think here at the

0:15:25.470,0:15:27.609
the exact words and the wire bridge

0:15:27.609,0:15:30.900
well i think it's a pretty good estimate
of our station location

0:15:30.900,0:15:33.820
and be nice to see if there are right in
the middle of this or if they're off to

0:15:33.820,0:15:37.010
one side of the other so let's go ahead

0:15:37.010,0:15:38.590
put them up there

0:15:38.590,0:15:43.620
the first will to here today to protect
right there at the center so piano

0:15:43.620,0:15:45.810
peaked

0:15:45.810,0:15:48.780
and this is the text for it's going to
be on our screen

0:15:48.780,0:15:51.730
this is a pretty flexible community
while you can do with it and listen to

0:15:51.730,0:15:55.140
the basics so x como x_y_

0:15:55.140,0:15:59.910
equals now this news he means

0:15:59.910,0:16:02.910
argument and we'll talk more about those
in the future

0:16:02.910,0:16:06.440
but this way if there's a lot of our
guns to function you can just caught one

0:16:06.440,0:16:07.890
my name

0:16:07.890,0:16:10.779
and will say were acting like

0:16:10.779,0:16:13.589
it's good to be here so it's a x
coverage

0:16:13.589,0:16:16.440
looks mostly average

0:16:16.440,0:16:19.330
uh... ex-con mark coverage

0:16:19.330,0:16:23.040
uh... of whining

0:16:23.040,0:16:26.320
never been a number of princess e
there's always a challenge here and

0:16:26.320,0:16:28.400
since we don't have a magic

0:16:28.400,0:16:33.620
flashing property that you would have an
imax as we have to hear amounts

0:16:33.620,0:16:35.830
one last word in the morning

0:16:35.830,0:16:37.820
and

0:16:37.820,0:16:40.190
we need to match this over here

0:16:40.190,0:16:41.789
rates or that

0:16:41.789,0:16:45.200
anti and if you see center appeared
great over here

0:16:45.200,0:16:46.860
so it's very nice

0:16:46.860,0:16:51.840
and statistical right next to it now you
can control how did it was plotted

0:16:51.840,0:16:57.940
so that a fault it was a blue line and
let's go ahead and create opponent bats

0:16:57.940,0:17:02.630
will plot with what we want we want to
read circle school say plots

0:17:02.630,0:17:08.089
aboriginal acts comer coverage uh...
wise that gives us

0:17:08.089,0:17:11.200
a list of one analyst of one

0:17:11.200,0:17:13.419
him and will say we want

0:17:13.419,0:17:18.009
with red and a circle now if you have a
look at the codes for all the different

0:17:18.009,0:17:20.819
colors and shapes but i remember that
chorus for red

0:17:20.819,0:17:25.249
and pro is for must not terribly spoiled
because for circle

0:17:25.249,0:17:27.209
soviet answer

0:17:27.209,0:17:30.260
and we now have a little rat dot
ornamental

0:17:30.260,0:17:33.590
so that's the very basics of plotting
was pretty well

0:17:33.590,0:17:37.010
and let's talk a little bit about
getting our data into something that

0:17:37.010,0:17:41.650
means little more twisted latitude
longitude and the tool called proj

0:17:41.650,0:17:43.639
and it has a pipe bomb interface

0:17:43.639,0:17:47.570
cult type ravaged and that will let us
actually do

0:17:47.570,0:17:50.430
great circle maths and so if we have two
points

0:17:50.430,0:17:53.490
it will give us the distance and need a
recipient

0:17:53.490,0:17:55.010
the direction both

0:17:55.010,0:17:59.190
to from point one two point zero point
two point one

0:17:59.190,0:18:02.750
or it also has other functions to
projections and whatnot or just give you

0:18:02.750,0:18:07.690
something called g_e_ odp that will

0:18:07.690,0:18:11.200
listed that critical mass so let's go
ahead and import

0:18:11.200,0:18:13.490
pi proj

0:18:13.490,0:18:15.520
and it's a pipe rides

0:18:15.520,0:18:17.930
period gpl d

0:18:17.930,0:18:22.150
and once it is a question mark asked for
some help refusal to acquire so we can

0:18:22.150,0:18:25.670
actually read the text

0:18:25.670,0:18:27.500
entered

0:18:27.500,0:18:31.780
and said straight here performs for an
inverse did you get a corporate circle

0:18:31.780,0:18:35.800
complications support competition
involves turning latitude longitude

0:18:35.800,0:18:37.029
impact hasn't

0:18:37.029,0:18:38.600
determines point

0:18:38.600,0:18:42.279
and we actually wants the timbers

0:18:42.279,0:18:47.100
so we can go ahead and try that out
speaking first have to create a g_o_p_

0:18:47.100,0:18:48.290
object

0:18:48.290,0:18:52.060
which actually we have to tell which
ellipsoid we'd like to use as a love so

0:18:52.060,0:18:54.679
it is not something that you did too
much

0:18:54.679,0:18:56.730
in this class but

0:18:56.730,0:18:59.390
they're basically the shape of the earth
and it's a bunch of different

0:18:59.390,0:19:01.780
approximations for that particular use

0:19:01.780,0:19:02.770
bernie is the same

0:19:02.770,0:19:05.080
one as the g_p_s_ system

0:19:05.080,0:19:10.010
toilet equals w g_s_ eighty four

0:19:10.010,0:19:13.059
pressed enter than i wouldn't say g_e_
would be

0:19:13.059,0:19:14.360
period

0:19:14.360,0:19:15.269
chris patten

0:19:15.269,0:19:19.000
and we can see there's a couple
different functions america can also use

0:19:19.000,0:19:25.000
padilla or command post what's inside
animals here forward converse

0:19:25.000,0:19:31.600
so let's go ahead and typed yuki inverse
question mark as he went to terrence

0:19:31.600,0:19:35.460
and this actually calculates wistful to
pairs of luck

0:19:35.460,0:19:36.860
long and laugh

0:19:36.860,0:19:37.580
through its

0:19:37.580,0:19:40.120
acts immorally x and y

0:19:40.120,0:19:43.200
the distance and direction section
symington institute

0:19:43.200,0:19:46.630
two directions that distance let's go
ahead and give it a shot may have some

0:19:46.630,0:19:49.029
diluted sobel to say to you you go

0:19:49.029,0:19:50.049
inverse

0:19:50.049,0:19:54.460
emily use our first and last points and
array so acts

0:19:54.460,0:19:58.919
zero wise hero is the very first point

0:19:58.919,0:20:03.760
and then we'll use the second point for
the very last point which is why i acts

0:20:03.760,0:20:08.180
minus one so that i could see in the
rain is back to the very last point

0:20:08.180,0:20:12.460
and why stubbed its one

0:20:12.460,0:20:14.510
into brimming with this

0:20:14.510,0:20:19.180
preparedness defaults to giving us
degrees which is good enough for him

0:20:19.180,0:20:21.879
pressed enter and we actually see that

0:20:21.879,0:20:24.450
the here's the direction and agrees

0:20:24.450,0:20:29.790
senior citizens at five point three
meters that's not actually too bad

0:20:29.790,0:20:33.190
if you're trying to real-time kinematic
surveying with

0:20:33.190,0:20:36.769
uh... for had terrific surveying this is
not good enough but for just generally

0:20:36.769,0:20:39.970
uses knowing where you are this is
pretty good

0:20:39.970,0:20:43.500
sis in high school that gets us some
basic yet but we want to go through and

0:20:43.500,0:20:47.640
do that for everything so let's write
ourselves a little python modules

0:20:47.640,0:20:49.580
that watch a leak

0:20:49.580,0:20:54.440
run through the whole thing amp result
list of dear can

0:20:54.440,0:20:56.970
uh... distance in the years from our
coverage

0:20:56.970,0:20:58.489
to open up imax

0:20:58.489,0:21:01.750
will go into a control x control half

0:21:01.750,0:21:04.160
and we're going to be deo fifteen

0:21:04.160,0:21:09.950
so here we are torturing emo open up a
file called wonder pipe

0:21:09.950,0:21:13.100
into will start creating a python script

0:21:13.100,0:21:17.900
inside of anymore jewel you don't get
the imports that you had been cited by

0:21:17.900,0:21:19.250
pythons

0:21:19.250,0:21:22.090
otherwise you'd be hard to break manage
code

0:21:22.090,0:21:24.790
if you want to make sure that everything
is self-contained

0:21:24.790,0:21:26.640
so we need to comport

0:21:26.640,0:21:27.840
are

0:21:27.840,0:21:29.790
proj

0:21:29.790,0:21:33.820
but were also there need to import of
that stuff from pi lam now the mainland

0:21:33.820,0:21:36.330
and we need is called that number hyatt

0:21:36.330,0:21:38.020
import

0:21:38.020,0:21:39.760
number iron mpg

0:21:39.760,0:21:40.590
now

0:21:40.590,0:21:43.490
oftentimes people mickey leases so they
don't have to type

0:21:43.490,0:21:47.570
as long and name for it and that was
very common one for an empire notes and

0:21:47.570,0:21:52.960
keep cc as empty and now you only have
to refer to it has and p

0:21:52.960,0:21:55.109
selection confusion if you're new to
this

0:21:55.109,0:21:58.960
but it's what people tend to do salon
that follow the normal convention

0:21:58.960,0:22:03.070
don't start praying sinful to recruit a
function of death

0:22:03.070,0:22:05.529
tells us that we're gonna start function

0:22:05.529,0:22:10.300
recalled wonder let's introduce our list
of points

0:22:10.300,0:22:11.549
and we need to

0:22:11.549,0:22:15.210
pasadena a final minutes to read the
points from so

0:22:15.210,0:22:16.340
parliament

0:22:16.340,0:22:18.010
charwoman argument

0:22:18.010,0:22:19.340
breast cancer

0:22:19.340,0:22:22.930
and he max has done the appropriate
content before to see that we start our

0:22:22.930,0:22:24.850
function remember python

0:22:24.850,0:22:28.190
uses indentation to mark walks

0:22:28.190,0:22:32.580
so first we need to make ourselves that
d_o_d_ objects we can take history

0:22:32.580,0:22:34.649
overhears that we were doing

0:22:34.649,0:22:38.460
and we can look back through and say
okay here's what we didn't support copy

0:22:38.460,0:22:42.600
dot

0:22:42.600,0:22:45.380
wrecker order imax controlled wine again

0:22:45.380,0:22:46.960
or paste

0:22:46.960,0:22:50.950
and we've now create are are typically
used to do you are to get it

0:22:50.950,0:22:52.549
competitions

0:22:52.549,0:22:54.600
we need to load the data

0:22:54.600,0:22:57.909
answer that loading of data that was
back up here

0:22:57.909,0:23:02.750
crap number thirteen

0:23:02.750,0:23:04.180
and copied

0:23:04.180,0:23:06.030
and paste

0:23:06.030,0:23:09.420
so now we've looked up our data and we
need to start doing some calculation so

0:23:09.420,0:23:12.980
we're gonna be using their average quite
a bit dash to take a little bit of time

0:23:12.980,0:23:16.040
to compute an average so if you might
actually be a good idea to just do it

0:23:16.040,0:23:18.549
once so ex-spouse

0:23:18.549,0:23:21.860
equals uh... average

0:23:21.860,0:23:23.309
uh... acts

0:23:23.309,0:23:26.929
and why average equals average

0:23:26.929,0:23:28.530
uh... wine

0:23:28.530,0:23:29.650
pre an exciting

0:23:29.650,0:23:31.520
so now we have those states

0:23:31.520,0:23:33.000
enlarges build-up

0:23:33.000,0:23:34.550
generate of

0:23:34.550,0:23:36.660
uh... our distance

0:23:36.660,0:23:39.990
so will go ahead and say and premiers

0:23:39.990,0:23:41.500
equals

0:23:41.500,0:23:46.660
and empty list sort of stirred up until
a steamer nicu walks corrugated

0:23:46.660,0:23:48.320
fill it out with

0:23:48.320,0:23:51.900
lots of distance it's one for each of
our pockets

0:23:51.900,0:23:55.410
during stay four high in

0:23:55.410,0:23:57.900
range white of

0:23:57.900,0:23:58.930
acts

0:23:58.930,0:24:02.840
so what we've done here is the credit
for loop in the car i will be the index

0:24:02.840,0:24:04.890
into x_y_ and z_

0:24:04.890,0:24:08.970
they were used throughout

0:24:08.970,0:24:10.769
uh... ok salvador for a week

0:24:10.769,0:24:14.350
the clones start early pressed enter and
play

0:24:14.350,0:24:18.680
the python wouldn't imax on i think it's
another four spaces for instance

0:24:18.680,0:24:21.360
cornell attorney block with indentation

0:24:21.360,0:24:23.220
and most say

0:24:23.220,0:24:24.179
distance

0:24:24.179,0:24:25.740
equals

0:24:25.740,0:24:29.010
marin agreed that this g_e_ odi dot

0:24:29.010,0:24:30.549
universe

0:24:30.549,0:24:35.730
will start off with our coverage so
expound from a y

0:24:35.730,0:24:40.410
and then we'll take our points per point
they're working on so experts of all i

0:24:40.410,0:24:42.230
reworking

0:24:42.230,0:24:44.000
the i've acts

0:24:44.000,0:24:47.529
and watch them pot

0:24:47.529,0:24:50.190
okey dokey so now we've got that

0:24:50.190,0:24:55.540
especially calculates power

0:24:55.540,0:25:00.860
actually distance is not the right
things should be maybe

0:25:00.860,0:25:01.549
there

0:25:01.549,0:25:04.429
i'm gonna replaced that with results

0:25:04.429,0:25:07.560
now for a member of results over here

0:25:07.560,0:25:11.039
when we did are virtual backup to do
that

0:25:11.039,0:25:12.190
we cannot

0:25:12.190,0:25:16.159
the direction the distant second
direction going up the direct

0:25:16.159,0:25:18.620
and from point viewpoint a

0:25:18.620,0:25:21.320
animator distance so we have to get this
is

0:25:21.320,0:25:24.500
position zero analyst position one
position

0:25:24.500,0:25:28.200
kate so we need a second positions will
say it

0:25:28.200,0:25:30.309
uh... dot and

0:25:30.309,0:25:31.860
results sub

0:25:31.860,0:25:34.050
too

0:25:34.050,0:25:37.270
soren take that distance value
independent onto

0:25:37.270,0:25:40.770
are list of meters

0:25:40.770,0:25:44.820
looks pretty good and then we need to
return that back from the function so

0:25:44.820,0:25:46.660
that we can show you that data

0:25:46.660,0:25:50.080
so this looks like the first draft of
firms that might work so control x

0:25:50.080,0:25:51.809
control estates

0:25:51.809,0:25:54.820
and what's going to try it from payback

0:25:54.820,0:25:59.840
so we can say import to bring in our
module and wonder

0:25:59.840,0:26:01.190
pressed enter

0:26:01.190,0:26:04.919
and so now that oprah modules that we
can say terror

0:26:04.919,0:26:07.440
wander and see what's inside at warner

0:26:07.440,0:26:10.800
and inside there we've got our
wanderlust function

0:26:10.800,0:26:12.850
foods they wonder

0:26:12.850,0:26:15.700
wonder score list

0:26:15.700,0:26:20.130
an easy time passes a final name look
back here we have a final minutes to get

0:26:20.130,0:26:22.080
away

0:26:22.080,0:26:25.200
have knows my first bug while looking at
this time

0:26:25.200,0:26:29.370
i've heard coated that file name by
accident preppy stinging

0:26:29.370,0:26:31.490
so mentally that taxed

0:26:31.490,0:26:34.510
and hit the delete key grip control p

0:26:34.510,0:26:36.460

0:26:36.460,0:26:38.880
and controllers controller us

0:26:38.880,0:26:42.540
and rather than just go ahead and typed
document controller said to be more

0:26:42.540,0:26:43.220

0:26:43.220,0:26:46.050
comment in the airboats hold on offer
now and

0:26:46.050,0:26:47.520
and will say

0:26:47.520,0:26:51.280
now for just a import wonder were still
going to have that problem

0:26:51.280,0:26:52.919
we need to do you agree

0:26:52.919,0:26:56.029
reloaded

0:26:56.029,0:27:01.010
to update uh... module wander inside a
python typically what it does

0:27:01.010,0:27:05.950
what's called cashing worth hangs on
that module and safety code import a lot

0:27:05.950,0:27:09.470
inside of your cold only does it the
first time it needs to you

0:27:09.470,0:27:12.800
which is great when you're running in
production mode interaction

0:27:12.800,0:27:16.059
pricing again the fun part what we're
doing development trying things out

0:27:16.059,0:27:21.130

we can now put enough i mean seventy
thousand eleven tab

0:27:33.280,0:27:35.740
and our strength

0:27:35.740,0:27:39.680
and let's give it a go and now we want
to try and say that to a variable so we

0:27:39.680,0:27:44.370
can say and equals araceli blue safe
distances

0:27:44.370,0:27:45.650
equals

0:27:47.770,0:27:49.870
and we have some problems

0:27:49.870,0:27:55.080
let's go back here more work to our
blogs down the first one his load text

0:27:55.080,0:27:56.950
uh... i actually have

0:27:56.950,0:28:01.410
to come from behind sofa and peter live

0:28:01.410,0:28:04.779

0:28:08.220,0:28:09.960

0:28:19.960,0:28:21.770

0:28:24.820,0:28:27.779
are open and befriend rear-end again

0:28:27.779,0:28:28.970
it work for a little bit

0:28:28.970,0:28:32.670
and then it had troubles kane in here

0:28:32.670,0:28:35.909
understanding i can tell you what this
pair might mean

0:28:35.909,0:28:40.309
i believe it means that we have point
that is too close to our center average

0:28:40.309,0:28:41.620
suspect

0:28:41.620,0:28:45.049
doing the calculation for distance
doesn't really make sense

0:28:45.049,0:28:49.340
if two points at the same location
effectively in terms of the math than

0:28:49.340,0:28:53.559
there really is no sense of direction so
in that case

0:28:53.559,0:28:56.539
out it's going to go ahead and be upset
and just tell us that things are

0:28:56.539,0:28:57.730
troubled

0:28:57.730,0:28:58.840
and this brings up

0:28:58.840,0:29:02.519
someone to learn about with exceptions
that means that when you get

0:29:02.519,0:29:04.500
this uh... an error

0:29:04.500,0:29:08.630
political trees back here in that recent
exception

0:29:08.630,0:29:11.790
we can actually use that word engine

0:29:11.790,0:29:15.470
python hopes that one exception is
thrown to be something

0:29:15.470,0:29:19.830
in the calling three of functions that
knew how to handle exception and get

0:29:19.830,0:29:21.470
things back on track

0:29:21.470,0:29:22.830
in our case

0:29:22.830,0:29:26.020
we do we can actually say that if we get
this exception

0:29:26.020,0:29:31.000
we are the points to close to you the
aboriginal discover distance in zero

0:29:31.000,0:29:35.050
so that means we need to learn how to
try to catch these exceptions source to

0:29:35.050,0:29:39.520
an example of trying sound so when you
use exceptions

0:29:39.520,0:29:44.850
you put a trial around a bunch of
clothing so print

0:29:44.850,0:29:48.289
hello

0:29:48.289,0:29:51.670
and i can actually cause an exception
happened i think i might like

0:29:51.670,0:29:56.350
but just saying praise exception

0:29:56.350,0:30:00.330
this might be some you call to clear
kind of exception with their own

0:30:00.330,0:30:01.990
com hit enter

0:30:01.990,0:30:03.830
he increased a print

0:30:03.830,0:30:05.480
never

0:30:05.480,0:30:10.490
jets here so one exception happens we'll
skip any code until it gets to that

0:30:10.490,0:30:13.150
exception parkinson's operator

0:30:13.150,0:30:16.789
statistic except

0:30:16.789,0:30:19.200
lupus

0:30:19.200,0:30:21.500
and now we have an exception that

0:30:21.500,0:30:23.730
that's been caught

0:30:23.730,0:30:25.730
if you have problems you can then

0:30:25.730,0:30:29.520
pushups something new and say things are
bad or even get things back on track

0:30:29.520,0:30:31.420
select interupt

0:30:31.420,0:30:32.440
and try it out

0:30:32.440,0:30:35.480
and so you can see that the tribal came
in here

0:30:35.480,0:30:39.980
called print for hello exception dot
called so i jumped down here

0:30:39.980,0:30:44.500
and ran the code that was supposed to
handle that exception

0:30:44.500,0:30:47.080
we can put that into our code

0:30:47.080,0:30:50.210
sitting here and here are where we have
the problem

0:30:50.210,0:30:52.320
was it a try and colin

0:30:52.320,0:30:55.880
now they want the content of this
another walking effect on the king to

0:30:55.880,0:30:57.500
control a here

0:30:57.500,0:31:00.070
control speaks to a market for

0:31:00.070,0:31:02.120
and go down to lines

0:31:02.120,0:31:06.480
and we actually have been the papon
module some helpers

0:31:06.480,0:31:11.000
so shift regional radius control c great
for them

0:31:11.000,0:31:16.460
that controls the and and career then
shifted it right

0:31:16.460,0:31:20.450
that's always houston outdoor
entertaining spaces and then

0:31:20.450,0:31:23.750
pleasure to have been in that space to
get to the right spot

0:31:23.750,0:31:26.399
except

0:31:26.399,0:31:27.490
corn

0:31:27.490,0:31:31.560
and now we can say and uh... and

0:31:31.560,0:31:34.860
zero so that a large section

0:31:34.860,0:31:38.340
things are back on track and keep
working through the so would say that

0:31:38.340,0:31:40.230
control x control s

0:31:40.230,0:31:44.510
telescope try par for the contents will
go back up

0:31:44.510,0:31:46.070
to reload

0:31:46.070,0:31:49.110
him and move around part distances

0:31:49.110,0:31:53.020
presenter

0:31:53.020,0:31:57.710
week and their job and so now we can say
pot

0:31:57.710,0:31:59.899
c l_ a_ clear graph

0:31:59.899,0:32:02.690
and plot

0:32:02.690,0:32:06.490
distances

0:32:06.490,0:32:09.320
professor lets you gap

0:32:09.320,0:32:12.580
so mexico smaller

0:32:12.580,0:32:14.450
enacts

0:32:14.450,0:32:18.360
and we have a nice little graph this
insists this is fantastic sis gives us a

0:32:18.360,0:32:20.190
sense of the variation

0:32:20.190,0:32:22.299
from average throughout the day

0:32:22.299,0:32:26.419
because it's a have courage uh...

0:32:26.419,0:32:29.100
distances

0:32:29.100,0:32:32.010
him because he did our average distance
away from

0:32:32.010,0:32:33.489
sintering is

0:32:33.489,0:32:36.640
two point eight years

0:32:36.640,0:32:42.480
selected as a great sense of how good or
bad this g_p_s_ is still on this day

0:32:42.480,0:32:45.840
we typically works within a couple
meters

0:32:45.840,0:32:46.950
pretty nice

0:32:46.950,0:32:50.800
but now let's finish up by taking a look
at how to build

0:32:50.800,0:32:55.390
figures that contain multiple plots we
can summarize all of what's going on

0:32:55.390,0:32:59.960
and that's done wilson called subplots
where you can make multiple figure so

0:32:59.960,0:33:01.940
clear our figures re

0:33:01.940,0:33:06.720
i'm also make this a little smaller

0:33:06.720,0:33:10.450
sc that uh...

0:33:10.450,0:33:12.610
painful stacey layton

0:33:12.610,0:33:17.190
her figure is emptied and now we can use
the subplot commands

0:33:17.190,0:33:19.409
steve go ahead and create

0:33:19.409,0:33:20.610
how multi

0:33:20.610,0:33:23.010
layered plot

0:33:23.010,0:33:23.790
ends

0:33:23.790,0:33:28.410
who has done this with three numbers
sourcing subplot four one one

0:33:28.410,0:33:31.049
and what this means is we're going to
have for

0:33:31.049,0:33:32.820
individual plots in

0:33:32.820,0:33:34.680
terms of cooling down

0:33:34.680,0:33:38.200
wherein we have that's the number of
where i was growing up one calls will

0:33:38.200,0:33:40.530
run through all the way from left to the
right

0:33:40.530,0:33:43.760
and then we will start working on the
first one

0:33:43.760,0:33:46.130
now since my problem

0:33:46.130,0:33:49.080
is pattern half after matlab

0:33:49.080,0:33:53.890
and matlab counts for a one with the
stuff we have to deal with uh... case

0:33:53.890,0:33:58.059
where we don't actually come from zero
so politics

0:33:58.059,0:33:59.559
door and hit enter

0:33:59.559,0:34:03.500
to look over here were now i'm working
on the first of four figures so we can

0:34:03.500,0:34:07.390
say plot acts

0:34:07.390,0:34:11.300
looks great now we can turn to the
second one so will go up to our subplot

0:34:11.300,0:34:15.129
command and replace at last summer with
too

0:34:15.129,0:34:20.019
an outfit plot

0:34:20.019,0:34:21.319
that's nice

0:34:21.319,0:34:23.029
and then we can say

0:34:23.029,0:34:27.449
plot with communities subplot breed

0:34:27.449,0:34:29.179
and we continue

0:34:29.179,0:34:31.569
plot

0:34:31.569,0:34:33.549
distance

0:34:33.549,0:34:36.139
groups

0:34:36.139,0:34:38.589
distances plural

0:34:38.589,0:34:42.749
so that's not our distance crashed in
north and now colossal not going to do

0:34:42.749,0:34:46.859
is a histogram plot of what those
distances are like so we can see through

0:34:46.859,0:34:48.809
the distribution of

0:34:48.809,0:34:51.149
how far away things are

0:34:51.149,0:34:55.509
and histograms are typically don clean
coal pets

0:34:55.509,0:34:56.839
each uske

0:34:56.839,0:35:02.379
tourists go up to our subplot and most
of jumped number four

0:35:02.379,0:35:07.479
when the slightest applicants the
extreme we'll build it

0:35:07.479,0:35:09.259
and so you can say

0:35:09.259,0:35:10.879
hits

0:35:10.879,0:35:13.719
and then any ablest of

0:35:13.719,0:35:17.159
happened so we can first do question
mark issue with the forests and the key

0:35:17.159,0:35:21.179
thing to note here is that histograms
matter very much about how many bands

0:35:21.179,0:35:22.839
you can use

0:35:22.839,0:35:27.639
to start up for the fall two pencils
give the other tribes escapist

0:35:27.639,0:35:30.599
distances press answer

0:35:30.599,0:35:34.119
families here has turned down here with
an attendance

0:35:34.119,0:35:37.179
that doesn't tell us too much about our
distribution

0:35:37.179,0:35:40.859
it might have some sort of various
pattern down here the averages break

0:35:40.859,0:35:42.319
down here

0:35:42.319,0:35:46.199
so let's go ahead and tell to have more
benso distances

0:35:46.199,0:35:51.119
we can say bins equals

0:35:51.119,0:35:54.229
and we'll see a new history and drop
right on top of that he can keep adding

0:35:54.229,0:35:57.899
to any particular plot more figures as
you go or we could do you maybe three

0:35:57.899,0:36:00.419
hundred and see how that works

0:36:00.419,0:36:02.609
adams had too much very well

0:36:02.609,0:36:04.430
so maybe we won't do anything

0:36:04.430,0:36:08.009
uh... c l_ a_ hopefully that will just
to that one axes

0:36:08.009,0:36:12.749
and that cleared out just that one
subplot and we can then run our history

0:36:12.749,0:36:15.719
and we'll strike that

0:36:15.719,0:36:19.469
so there is our final plug of how we did
and you can see the averages right

0:36:19.469,0:36:21.039
around here

0:36:21.039,0:36:26.009
far distance from her century and ever
g_p_s_ amounts are first lesson on

0:36:26.009,0:36:28.919
plotting with map upward in python

0:36:28.919,0:36:30.679
i hope you come back for more

0:36:30.679,0:36:35.249
and that against has been uh...
elections forward the

0:36:35.249,0:36:39.180
research tools courts at the center for
kal solution i think that the signature

0:36:39.180,0:36:39.470
