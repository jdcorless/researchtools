welcome to u research tools video tape
and imax part-time loads my name is kurt

0:00:07.500,0:00:10.369
shillinger innings video visual medium

0:00:10.369,0:00:13.989
and some of the major roads and minor
militantly max and these are

0:00:13.989,0:00:15.960
stateful things that control

0:00:15.960,0:00:19.789
howie max looks and works in each
particular buffered

0:00:19.789,0:00:23.589
so let's start off with one of the
fundamental months the fundamental mode

0:00:23.589,0:00:25.210
for major

0:00:25.210,0:00:26.100
if we

0:00:26.100,0:00:28.250
jump to use some random buffered

0:00:28.250,0:00:31.779
you'll see that here when he makes
doesn't have a particular roden

0:00:31.779,0:00:35.640
it says fundamental down here this is
the mode that has no special additions

0:00:35.640,0:00:36.540
to it

0:00:36.540,0:00:37.820
so please open up

0:00:37.820,0:00:41.250
a file it here just call it flew

0:00:41.250,0:00:42.320
this file

0:00:42.320,0:00:44.090
has no information about

0:00:44.090,0:00:45.400
kids file find

0:00:45.400,0:00:48.000
so this is called fundamental

0:00:48.000,0:00:52.550
another common mode you'll see hits

0:00:52.550,0:00:55.690
let's try to read me dot t_ exceed

0:00:55.690,0:01:00.660
and it looked at the dot t_ a_ t_ and
said that this is a technology

0:01:00.660,0:01:02.150
down here in the buffer below

0:01:02.150,0:01:07.380
and on the rate will see that why uh...
stands for ya snippets and desert stupid

0:01:07.380,0:01:11.170
additions this is a minor mods come
after it

0:01:11.170,0:01:14.490
call just go back to the notes here

0:01:14.490,0:01:18.610
and there's a good number of mode so we
can't open a price on file

0:01:18.610,0:01:21.500
that can say that

0:01:21.500,0:01:23.450
controllers control have

0:01:23.450,0:01:25.520
my files up on

0:01:25.520,0:01:29.650
and based on the extension down he
recalls the papon farm

0:01:29.650,0:01:33.909
we can also say my file

0:01:33.909,0:01:37.540
with an assessment from the moment here
but we can say

0:01:37.540,0:01:41.230
for simple pound bang

0:01:41.230,0:01:42.790
fashion

0:01:42.790,0:01:48.740
we can say that controllers controller
us amici lameta acts research

0:01:48.740,0:01:52.909
buffer this will require the final
status can reset the modem

0:01:52.909,0:01:54.980
so quiet yes

0:01:54.980,0:01:56.220
business now

0:01:56.220,0:02:00.130
is it to the first one in a file on said
oh wait this is actually a bash script

0:02:00.130,0:02:03.650
so let's set the bash mowed down here

0:02:03.650,0:02:06.740
works quite well

0:02:06.740,0:02:10.369
they will kill those

0:02:10.369,0:02:16.689
and let's look at sti more votes than
you probably run into if we'd save

0:02:16.689,0:02:19.279
fruit dot him alone

0:02:19.279,0:02:24.049
news doesn't show up as external even
though we know the camo his x_ amount

0:02:24.049,0:02:25.240
but we can say

0:02:25.240,0:02:27.449
through dot x_ amount

0:02:27.449,0:02:29.420
and i think she marked as being

0:02:29.420,0:02:31.849
texan now and there's a uh...

0:02:31.849,0:02:35.349
mode here says an accent now has
actually validating

0:02:35.349,0:02:39.140
the personal scheme as we go so it's
pretty exciting to be able to have a

0:02:39.140,0:02:42.609
check your code as you go

0:02:42.609,0:02:45.959
consist home page dot html

0:02:45.959,0:02:49.309
and you'll see it's now as you know how
perot he and it's even

0:02:49.309,0:02:53.649
create template for me to start with
affected my tax so

0:02:53.649,0:02:55.569
type your web

0:02:55.569,0:02:58.849
page here

0:02:58.849,0:03:02.529
so let's go open

0:03:02.529,0:03:03.579
just

0:03:03.579,0:03:04.599
are

0:03:04.599,0:03:05.749
corporate bond

0:03:05.749,0:03:10.219
and knows here the down here it says
organs has wrapped

0:03:10.219,0:03:15.760
rapp says to refa textile iran kendall
had offering inside of the screen

0:03:15.760,0:03:19.349
but we can also if we want to see what's
going on for example we have to be able

0:03:19.349,0:03:23.299
to make this point

0:03:23.299,0:03:29.369
tonight she just link with control c
control chrome and i'm a high-tech

0:03:29.369,0:03:31.120
hidden wellington

0:03:31.120,0:03:34.049
so now are hidden link doesn't look like
very much

0:03:34.049,0:03:39.120
but if we switch back to text known text

0:03:39.120,0:03:42.559
we now are back in a more that doesn't
know anything about working on and so

0:03:42.559,0:03:46.709
things like links get turned into their
actual broadcast

0:03:46.709,0:03:51.579
so here you see on the square brackets
fico for creating a a list

0:03:51.579,0:03:54.659
then we can go back and acts quirk

0:03:54.659,0:03:58.019
dash mood

0:03:58.019,0:04:02.109
and we're now back at work on so that
was manifests context mode and then

0:04:02.109,0:04:05.689
uh... export

0:04:05.689,0:04:08.849
there are several other motive we might
want to try and

0:04:08.849,0:04:15.849
no one that i would keep on a lot as
mentor x forests tunnel mode

0:04:15.889,0:04:19.639
what flights those doing is actually as
you move the cursor orchestrating the

0:04:19.639,0:04:21.290
spelling of the word that

0:04:21.290,0:04:22.919
as underneath

0:04:22.919,0:04:24.240
and we can do

0:04:24.240,0:04:25.370
that a dollar

0:04:25.370,0:04:30.540
and correct there were if it had a very
spelling

0:04:30.540,0:04:34.370
and there's another wrote that's also
very anyone writing

0:04:34.370,0:04:36.909
if we have bright

0:04:36.909,0:04:39.789
writer really want sensitive we'd

0:04:39.789,0:04:41.489
right

0:04:41.489,0:04:42.229
really

0:04:42.229,0:04:44.150
well on

0:04:44.150,0:04:45.509

eight will see ticket seventy five

0:04:52.869,0:04:55.459
default

0:04:55.459,0:04:58.389
then the decline

0:04:58.389,0:04:59.929
the nicer

0:04:59.929,0:05:05.960
if hit was wrapped

phil

0:05:16.780,0:05:19.209
tonight cfl down here

0:05:19.209,0:05:21.850
if you go to the end of this with
control ukb

0:05:21.850,0:05:26.479
and the fight over a period or whatever
or add something in that space

0:05:26.479,0:05:30.279
it's going to reflow or refill about her

0:05:30.279,0:05:33.259
now what if i messed it up

0:05:33.259,0:05:35.470
there's a key massive leather

0:05:35.470,0:05:36.499

terry ref alliance spokesman like you

0:05:39.150,0:05:42.840
well reflow that point

0:05:42.840,0:05:45.860
there's a couple other really neat once
we can say

0:05:45.860,0:05:48.029
control you

0:05:48.029,0:05:50.580
which is the perimeter keith

0:05:50.580,0:05:52.629
forty

0:05:52.629,0:05:55.540
sewer and i think this bs forty
character

0:05:55.540,0:05:57.199
how calm

0:05:57.199,0:05:59.280
and will say control x

0:05:59.280,0:06:00.660
and after

0:06:00.660,0:06:04.820
an oklahoma city forty if we do know
that you we have much narrower one

0:06:04.820,0:06:07.240
specific and you control you

0:06:07.240,0:06:08.990
twenty

0:06:08.990,0:06:12.179
and now if you could relax permanent

and then he could relax customer back
toward normal

0:06:28.189,0:06:32.619
into some other really nice features in
an so that was medic hw which we have

0:06:32.619,0:06:34.929
breakdown

0:06:34.929,0:06:36.080
phil region

0:06:36.080,0:06:40.389
you can pick the whole region until it's
up in a couple paragraphs with me

0:06:40.389,0:06:43.860
crunch them all up

0:06:43.860,0:06:46.270
and if we highlight the region

0:06:46.270,0:06:48.069
geometrics

0:06:48.069,0:06:50.839
phil parisians

0:06:50.839,0:06:56.029
it will end three flow all the
paragraphs in that area

0:06:56.029,0:06:58.870
now if we have uh... a title

0:06:58.870,0:07:01.309
mine title

0:07:01.309,0:07:05.259
that needs cute p censored

0:07:05.259,0:07:08.360
if we do you

0:07:08.360,0:07:11.199
meta

0:07:11.199,0:07:15.139
meta past that's now centered

0:07:27.049,0:07:30.779
history center with that column

0:07:30.779,0:07:32.639
source very nicely

0:07:32.639,0:07:36.130
dell com from an echo opened up a python
file

0:07:36.130,0:07:39.069
my file thought pine

0:07:39.069,0:07:44.210
interpreted to take a look at where my
roots that's in their beyond scope

0:07:44.210,0:07:45.800
also as a minor mode

0:07:45.800,0:07:49.149
and yes if it's is coming around

0:07:49.149,0:07:53.159
and what it has a whole bunch of tax
that spree built for you to inserted

0:07:53.159,0:07:55.229
tear programs

0:07:55.229,0:07:59.599
for example if i go down to

0:07:59.599,0:08:04.389
this one drops internet

0:08:04.389,0:08:05.599
by default

0:08:05.599,0:08:07.219
not very exciting

0:08:07.219,0:08:14.219
let's try for everyone's will go down
here and say stupid

0:08:14.439,0:08:16.360
tight on again

0:08:16.360,0:08:18.310
he ends

0:08:18.310,0:08:20.000
here's a good common one

0:08:20.000,0:08:23.710
so impressed on programs when you have a
script

0:08:23.710,0:08:29.229
and he wanted to find a function of
death hello

0:08:29.229,0:08:33.100
print

0:08:33.100,0:08:35.580
paroled

0:08:35.580,0:08:37.660
you know what happens here it is

0:08:37.660,0:08:42.010
the only time that this name variable is
set to main is when this is actually

0:08:42.010,0:08:44.200
running as a script

0:08:44.200,0:08:48.250
so what this does was will let us import
all the functions in here but not run

0:08:48.250,0:08:51.680
the main code soapy wonderbra via
command-line interface we would do it in

0:08:51.680,0:08:53.440
here

0:08:53.440,0:08:56.770
so for example we can say helical

0:08:56.770,0:09:01.700
so only if the call from america we
actually get hello separate you control

0:09:01.700,0:09:07.890
c control seated on the whole pipeline
file it's bright hasn't committed hello

0:09:07.890,0:09:10.370
now if we do

0:09:10.370,0:09:13.820
uh... basi will jump back you are
terminal

0:09:13.820,0:09:16.730
and if we do

0:09:16.730,0:09:18.580
taipei taiwan

0:09:18.580,0:09:23.340
colossus como se import my filed pie

to amber import

0:09:29.890,0:09:31.770
mind file

0:09:31.770,0:09:35.770
and noticed that it didn't actually run
meeting him

0:09:35.770,0:09:39.529
that pythons cricket just loaded up our
fortune so keep in mind

0:09:39.529,0:09:41.610
file

0:09:41.610,0:09:42.579
hello

0:09:42.579,0:09:44.940
and went out on her function

0:09:44.940,0:09:48.570
so having said it's like that makes life
a lot easier you can actually look at

0:09:48.570,0:09:54.480
your own snippets anish if it's for a
lot of different modes so if you'd like

0:09:54.480,0:09:57.560
seem though there's a lot of things you
can answer for c

0:09:57.560,0:09:59.930
sleepless plus

0:09:59.930,0:10:02.610
uh... imax list

0:10:02.610,0:10:08.890
html picture has tons so we can circle
for finishing ave one insert header

0:10:08.890,0:10:12.410
you can do it died just about anywhere
and it doesn't really necessary makes

0:10:12.410,0:10:13.420
sense

0:10:13.420,0:10:16.970
and there's also some time short cuts if
you look over here

0:10:16.970,0:10:18.910
to confront one under

0:10:18.910,0:10:20.420
papam

0:10:20.420,0:10:22.520
if we

0:10:22.520,0:10:24.820
typed four

0:10:24.820,0:10:27.250
so what's killed and three type

0:10:27.250,0:10:29.320
castro or press tab

0:10:29.320,0:10:32.690
and actually starts completing item hand

0:10:32.690,0:10:39.000
and then we can save on to you

0:10:39.000,0:10:42.469
and so by pressing tab throughout some
three different blocks

0:10:42.469,0:10:44.960
say yes if it is really exciting road

0:10:44.960,0:10:48.410
and its people create more shipments for
different languages and you start

0:10:48.410,0:10:49.740
treating them with people

0:10:49.740,0:10:52.310
she'll certainly have a library of
things to help you move pretty quickly

0:10:52.310,0:10:56.360
with regards

0:10:56.360,0:10:57.949
through all the philly are stupid

0:11:04.019,0:11:08.030
right moon instead of typing in between

0:11:08.030,0:11:10.930
we can write break on top of the text

0:11:10.930,0:11:12.410
and if we do

0:11:12.410,0:11:13.329

and if you read helping control peach
