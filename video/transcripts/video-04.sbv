welcome to u research tools video for
yet more imax my name is curt schreiner

0:00:06.769,0:00:10.819
and statement to he threw a little bit
more uh... imax

0:00:10.819,0:00:15.289
i've created in or growth file to have a
overview of what we'll do today

0:00:15.289,0:00:17.730
inmates little short

0:00:17.730,0:00:22.119
will look at the car crash artsy file
which sets up are shown

0:00:22.119,0:00:25.869
we'll take a look at some fun things
inside at the imax cut rates and the

0:00:25.869,0:00:27.679
doctor program

0:00:27.679,0:00:31.879
will look at man pages inside of the max
who look at documentation inside of the

0:00:31.879,0:00:34.450
max and infosystems

0:00:34.450,0:00:38.040
and we'll take a quick peak that's a
large purple file

0:00:38.040,0:00:43.430
animal gravity tar file that's from that
class hang watch a show you that you can

0:00:43.430,0:00:44.550
get into you

0:00:44.550,0:00:49.680
that insides avatar file without and
concurrent on charges for unpacking this

0:00:49.680,0:00:52.220
archive of many files

0:00:52.220,0:00:57.140
let's go ahead and it started since but
my screen here with control acts to

0:00:57.140,0:01:00.870
and and i put leave this up on the top
of my list and i went to the bottom

0:01:00.870,0:01:04.449
window control accident an order over

0:01:04.449,0:01:05.339
and

0:01:05.339,0:01:09.900
let's start by opening up our docking
max file a monument to annex

0:01:09.900,0:01:12.880
come for the default bachelor sea

0:01:12.880,0:01:17.400
this is a configuration file that
controls how the shell runs

0:01:17.400,0:01:20.590
and this is a shell script basically
tickets run every time you create new

0:01:20.590,0:01:21.940
shelved

0:01:21.940,0:01:24.640
and it's got lots of different options
in it

0:01:24.640,0:01:27.869
but there's one i'd like to add to it
isn't in there

0:01:27.869,0:01:29.360
and uh...

0:01:29.360,0:01:34.190
for the fear that they have a dot bashed
aliases file so we can do control excuse

0:01:34.190,0:01:37.860
put that and we'll see if there is a dot
bash

0:01:37.860,0:01:40.200
aliases

0:01:40.200,0:01:42.210
and there's not it's a new file

0:01:42.210,0:01:45.280
thoughts create some quick aliases

0:01:45.280,0:01:48.610
presage helios power and equals

0:01:48.610,0:01:50.900
are and that side

0:01:50.900,0:01:54.980
helios andy equals andy

0:01:54.980,0:01:56.390
nationally

0:01:56.390,0:01:58.560
alias c_p_ equals

0:01:58.560,0:02:04.960
sleepy

0:02:04.960,0:02:11.259
now before i say this and then switch
over in the starter selma defects shall

0:02:11.259,0:02:12.540
and will type

0:02:12.540,0:02:17.919
alias and regret for or m

0:02:17.919,0:02:22.899
so there is no actually it's for our agm
and its yet who did not to be leases

0:02:22.899,0:02:24.799
if we quit

0:02:24.799,0:02:27.579
the show exit the shelf pardon me

0:02:27.579,0:02:29.869
kill its control x k

0:02:29.869,0:02:32.489
and still ahead can save

0:02:32.489,0:02:36.419
control x control s our passion aliases

0:02:36.419,0:02:42.659
africa controllers go to go back to this
window molding meta factional again

0:02:42.659,0:02:46.579
phenomena show on the tape helios r m

0:02:46.579,0:02:49.629
and we'll see now that we have an alias
for or m

0:02:49.629,0:02:51.599
now what is the silliest q

0:02:51.599,0:02:55.419
the says if we touch a file touch

0:02:55.419,0:02:56.980
our agm through

0:02:56.980,0:03:01.509
it's not going to ask us to do we
actually wants to leave this file not

0:03:01.509,0:03:05.619
this will happen dispute recovering from
a file ask you yes or no

0:03:05.619,0:03:09.509
just remember that if you do in our and
dash f fu it's not going to have to

0:03:09.509,0:03:11.999
anything aphids perforce

0:03:11.999,0:03:14.889
finality add a little bit of

0:03:14.889,0:03:17.769
safety to our show fireman's and

0:03:17.769,0:03:23.179
we're also seen r dot basher risky
expand our passion releases

0:03:23.179,0:03:26.989
you can spend quite a time customizing
your aries inside the shuttle

0:03:26.989,0:03:28.519
but i want to show you

0:03:28.519,0:03:34.919
out those three aces that i think should
be an paul basher c files

0:03:34.919,0:03:37.509
so let's go back up to our toplist

0:03:37.509,0:03:40.639
animals you control it's one of the hide
everything else and

0:03:40.639,0:03:42.839
whilst they were done with this

0:03:42.839,0:03:45.879
controls the controlled seek

0:03:45.879,0:03:50.709
imax isn't just support extending it has
all kinds of people bilities

0:03:50.709,0:03:54.289
now well this is an important election
shows you how powerful he mixes so let's

0:03:54.289,0:03:57.379
go ahead and run tetris cement acts

0:03:57.379,0:03:58.940
and give you the

0:03:58.940,0:04:04.269
play three k entering any interactive
community max might have

0:04:04.269,0:04:05.459
tetris

0:04:05.459,0:04:08.650
from there's only one tetris i had to
have to complete it

0:04:08.650,0:04:10.589
democrat nick

0:04:10.589,0:04:14.289
and this shows you that imax is actually
quite powerful has all sorts of features

0:04:14.289,0:04:15.219
in it

0:04:15.219,0:04:18.299
we can play tetris to our hearts desire

0:04:18.299,0:04:21.729
you missed a lot of time

0:04:21.729,0:04:25.330
uh... pardon the care about the game
scores is not set up

0:04:25.330,0:04:27.759
partly for games in this fertile machine

0:04:27.759,0:04:29.699
or not can actually care about

0:04:29.699,0:04:32.990
to control exchange kill tetris and make
it go away

0:04:32.990,0:04:36.229
control that's warned to hide all the
other windows

0:04:36.229,0:04:40.380
and word i'm looking at tetris control
so you can proceed

0:04:40.380,0:04:42.249
so let's talk to the doctor

0:04:42.249,0:04:46.199
this is the elisa program based on
commercial work in the sixties and

0:04:46.199,0:04:47.190
seventies

0:04:47.190,0:04:49.599
strength simulate human being

0:04:49.599,0:04:52.539
within the next dr

0:04:52.539,0:04:56.829
we run a program called the
psychotherapist them if you talk to this

0:04:56.829,0:04:58.330
and we can say

0:04:58.330,0:05:02.060
i and trying to learned

0:05:02.060,0:05:03.789
immense

0:05:03.789,0:05:05.549
answer center

0:05:05.549,0:05:06.840
and

0:05:06.840,0:05:10.360
we couldn't get a response back from
nineteen you can say

0:05:10.360,0:05:17.289
i do you know wants to houston the art

0:05:17.289,0:05:23.969
hi few not quite

0:05:23.969,0:05:26.160
now it's it's just uh... a little
program

0:05:26.160,0:05:28.490
inside of the max

0:05:28.490,0:05:30.050
and doesn't make a lot of sense

0:05:30.050,0:05:31.450
but it's a lot of fun

0:05:31.450,0:05:35.680
and ticket distance tracy you can write
interactive programs insanity maxim do

0:05:35.680,0:05:37.229
all sorts of things

0:05:37.229,0:05:40.050
let's go ahead and kill them with
control at st

0:05:40.050,0:05:41.409
breast cancer

0:05:41.409,0:05:48.149
and it will now markets office has done
with control c controlled seek

0:05:48.149,0:05:50.570
inside of the classes we talked about it

0:05:50.570,0:05:54.770
agreement pages for various programs
instead of unix

0:05:54.770,0:05:57.629
who might want to do a statement from
the inside of you max as much as

0:05:57.629,0:06:02.400
possible and we can still get those men
pages so it's two men tax man press

0:06:02.400,0:06:03.969
enter

0:06:03.969,0:06:05.629
and we can then type in

0:06:05.629,0:06:07.309
safety are

0:06:07.309,0:06:08.100
and

0:06:08.100,0:06:09.339
press answer

0:06:09.339,0:06:10.729
we're now looking at

0:06:10.729,0:06:12.139
began patrol expo

0:06:12.139,0:06:13.669
through page

0:06:13.669,0:06:17.369
the main page for translation

0:06:17.369,0:06:20.899
and you can then scroll through to take
control of you go down

0:06:20.899,0:06:23.720
meant to be to go up

0:06:23.720,0:06:24.900
kaspersky

0:06:24.900,0:06:27.240
or vena less then

0:06:27.240,0:06:30.630
top-ten skate greater than the right

0:06:30.630,0:06:34.460
and this will issue uh... trophy
mentation take a look

0:06:34.460,0:06:37.880
now actually down here it's going to
listen to our next topic

0:06:37.880,0:06:40.199
and info is the

0:06:40.199,0:06:44.860
the new style uh... information more
than men pages they tend to focus more

0:06:44.860,0:06:47.470
of their rating into these info pages

0:06:47.470,0:06:49.769
do appear animals they were finished
with

0:06:49.769,0:06:51.430
man

0:06:51.430,0:06:56.219
and parochial control act zero inside
this window to hide it

0:06:56.219,0:06:59.599
and schoolwork pat info this info system

0:06:59.599,0:07:00.539
made attacks

0:07:00.539,0:07:01.820
info

0:07:01.820,0:07:05.059
his deep basically online books for

0:07:05.059,0:07:07.849
imax in all of the commute tools

0:07:07.849,0:07:11.740
this process sections and tons of
documentation in here

0:07:11.740,0:07:16.180
and that fiction room care the most
about is the in that section

0:07:16.180,0:07:18.449
and so inside of here you can see

0:07:18.449,0:07:21.759
there's lots of plugins for e_m_s_
command and for example here is the

0:07:21.759,0:07:27.479
manual for the e r_c_ heresy trial
contents that were used in the cards

0:07:27.479,0:07:32.339
and there's a how to program insider he
maximalist there's the actual imax

0:07:32.339,0:07:36.770
manual self-selected for a look at that
point in a press enter

0:07:36.770,0:07:38.599
salo dot the manual for

0:07:38.599,0:07:41.940
he met you could see that this man has
been around for a long time since the

0:07:41.940,0:07:43.900
nineteen eighties

0:07:43.900,0:07:47.699
you can see there lots and lots of
features available inside him acting you

0:07:47.699,0:07:53.410
can read all about all the details

0:07:53.410,0:07:56.310
and you can then use the mouse to scroll
raring to go up

0:07:56.310,0:07:57.929
can you can see

0:07:57.929,0:08:01.639
click on the turret emmanuel and you
couldn't say

0:08:01.639,0:08:06.479
next go to counter one and we can go
back to the top

0:08:06.479,0:08:08.340
so there's a ton of documentation here

0:08:08.340,0:08:11.559
if you're looking for something specific
you can go through it and try to find it

0:08:11.559,0:08:14.819
and if you're interested in more about
the new tools and talk about incentives

0:08:14.819,0:08:19.409
max this is a great place to look at it
for example chuckle

0:08:19.409,0:08:20.680
talks about

0:08:20.680,0:08:25.900
more what you can do in there and how to
do all sorts of fancy advanced features

0:08:25.900,0:08:29.759
will control examen que to kill are
confirming them

0:08:29.759,0:08:33.920
i marked up off is done with control c
control c

0:08:33.920,0:08:36.739
analyst to something a little bit more
focused on the task

0:08:36.739,0:08:42.000
let's look at what your five from
research tools

0:08:42.000,0:08:44.290
inside of that

0:08:44.290,0:08:48.299
let's take a look starting with the copy
that's i do that

0:08:48.299,0:08:52.600
controls pasted to the beginning of mark
control each at the end

0:08:52.600,0:08:56.820
would know how the regional tournament w
copy that

0:08:56.820,0:09:00.400
him have jumped back and show

0:09:00.400,0:09:02.240
and it's happened

0:09:02.240,0:09:05.279
and and answer for shown so that was

0:09:05.279,0:09:08.740
met acts maybe to get the buffer list
and amp

0:09:08.740,0:09:12.470
so now i'm back in here

0:09:12.470,0:09:15.670
and take a look at our directory we have
our video four

0:09:15.670,0:09:18.650
lecture we also have pound final

0:09:18.650,0:09:22.330
this is a temporary file written by
email it's like a lot of states

0:09:22.330,0:09:26.550
two pcs coming go this is just enough
time to protect you from a crash or

0:09:26.550,0:09:27.140
system

0:09:27.140,0:09:28.860
power failure

0:09:28.860,0:09:31.640
so we've got the difference between
those two files that we can always do

0:09:31.640,0:09:33.390
edith

0:09:33.390,0:09:35.310
star video

0:09:35.310,0:09:36.630
four-star

0:09:36.630,0:09:38.920
and you'll see that there's just a
little bit of difference between life

0:09:38.920,0:09:41.920
and i saved it from what i've done

0:09:41.920,0:09:46.200
let's let's go ahead and use it in that
copy buffer is power probably want to

0:09:46.200,0:09:48.140
get the will to live w gets

0:09:48.140,0:09:51.030
and then they have control of wife
regained

0:09:51.030,0:09:55.949
and here's our lord you are all for the
org on file for the lecture five

0:09:55.949,0:09:57.290
presenter

0:09:57.290,0:10:01.090
did he get went off and grab that's open
to the callousness shown will now see

0:10:01.090,0:10:06.580
that we have lecture five let's go ahead
and open up

0:10:06.580,0:10:08.880
picture phones

0:10:08.880,0:10:11.120
such a control x control f

0:10:11.120,0:10:12.260
and then i did

0:10:12.260,0:10:14.690
if i've been in touch

0:10:14.690,0:10:17.750
i can see here is a very large
government final with lots of stuff

0:10:17.750,0:10:20.000
going on

0:10:20.000,0:10:22.580
painted research down for

0:10:22.580,0:10:25.430
control last comment that he gets

0:10:25.430,0:10:29.210
you'll see here we're doing is passing
over the death of this examples

0:10:29.210,0:10:31.880
nuances copy this your own

0:10:31.880,0:10:34.990
certain control space type he for and

0:10:34.990,0:10:37.980
and now the w two copy it

0:10:37.980,0:10:41.820
and let's go i'm switching to screen
control tax control

0:10:41.820,0:10:44.660
and that first kisi control x manitoba

0:10:44.660,0:10:50.060
phenomena to bash the shelf so mena
excuse me could relax and then a beat

0:10:50.060,0:10:54.890
uh... shelter the faults and press enter
and say did you get

0:10:54.890,0:10:57.650
and this large how you are adults with
heart

0:10:57.650,0:11:02.090
present at the moment what downloads its
own united by final

0:11:02.090,0:11:06.070
it's working alone something's content
generally work just like they do a

0:11:06.070,0:11:09.730
normal shell minus a few programs that
we've seen that les has trouble

0:11:09.730,0:11:14.350
with not being able to control the
screen

0:11:14.350,0:11:16.460
now inside of this example

0:11:16.460,0:11:20.200
we can't go back to tom and if we do

0:11:20.200,0:11:22.140
for passes will header stuff

0:11:22.140,0:11:24.000
anti-jewish shifts

0:11:24.000,0:11:25.090
and found

0:11:25.090,0:11:28.960
i think class the entire document into
that folder that we talked about in the

0:11:28.960,0:11:30.520
apartment lecture

0:11:30.520,0:11:34.730
and i can go dangling examples and i
compressed have just on this one and it

0:11:34.730,0:11:37.300
will spend just a little sample data

0:11:37.300,0:11:39.930
can heighten things

0:11:39.930,0:11:43.460
for thirty days just finished up their
appeal to control expert with commando

0:11:43.460,0:11:45.120
without the controlled

0:11:45.120,0:11:46.110
and now

0:11:46.110,0:11:47.420
were in here please

0:11:47.420,0:11:48.779
are examples what's

0:11:48.779,0:11:51.290
uncompressed that the unzipped team

0:11:51.290,0:11:53.060
examples

0:11:53.060,0:11:54.380
stamp

0:11:54.380,0:11:58.350
and tab forged just the same way that
would in almost all press center

0:11:58.350,0:12:01.010
and we're now on compressing that file

0:12:01.010,0:12:04.510
i'mma go back to appear in the through
the ordinary simple

0:12:04.510,0:12:06.780
and in this lecture you actually see
that we have

0:12:06.780,0:12:10.350
uh... example blocks that we haven't
heard before but this is just an on

0:12:10.350,0:12:11.540
highlighted

0:12:11.540,0:12:13.760
example blocks and exactly is

0:12:13.760,0:12:15.640
here's a source for example

0:12:15.640,0:12:17.100
hands

0:12:17.100,0:12:18.820
person you can actually run

0:12:18.820,0:12:21.150
so if you control expo

0:12:21.150,0:12:24.040
and take a look at our directory we now
have

0:12:24.040,0:12:26.280
an example dot park

0:12:26.280,0:12:29.710
imax is pretty powerful they can
actually open up

0:12:29.710,0:12:34.490
and large number of archive formats so
let's go ahead and just open up our

0:12:34.490,0:12:37.850
partner not consider buying might expect

0:12:37.850,0:12:40.800
it's really large we're going to say yes

0:12:40.800,0:12:42.560
and worn-out inside

0:12:42.560,0:12:46.340
of our car frescoes control x one to
show just

0:12:46.340,0:12:47.750
this buffer

0:12:47.750,0:12:50.400
committee now take a look through here
you can actually look at all these

0:12:50.400,0:12:52.160
examples and so on in

0:12:52.160,0:12:54.860
seem very similar to the juror admin

0:12:54.860,0:12:58.110
or if i can screw around i complete my
cursor on the file

0:12:58.110,0:13:01.930
and i can take a look and find it uh...
five presenter on shell script

0:13:01.930,0:13:05.150
i'm actually looking at uh... file
inside of a car

0:13:05.150,0:13:07.740
ends of the contents of that file

0:13:07.740,0:13:11.260
and you can see here in these shell
script bash moment we have

0:13:11.260,0:13:17.470
nice color and shows various parts of

0:13:17.470,0:13:20.310
going to take a look here we can take a
look down pat

0:13:20.310,0:13:24.840
crystal world dot seasons able see
program together since he before

0:13:24.840,0:13:28.220
the considers all sorts of helena show
us datatypes

0:13:28.220,0:13:29.810
function names

0:13:29.810,0:13:32.780
and strings

0:13:32.780,0:13:35.290
attitude control x k kill dot

0:13:35.290,0:13:36.209
and

0:13:36.209,0:13:37.510
that we're now back to our

0:13:37.510,0:13:40.370
party you three new control x two

0:13:40.370,0:13:44.870
control exit the let's go back to
compressed pound

0:13:44.870,0:13:46.560
our video four

0:13:46.560,0:13:47.730
lecture notes

0:13:47.730,0:13:51.210
and let's go ahead and marked off what
we've done here

0:13:51.210,0:13:54.720
with got that one gun control c control
seat at the park

0:13:54.720,0:13:55.940
and compress it

0:13:55.940,0:13:57.680
and look at what's inside

0:13:57.680,0:14:01.070
and that's it for this video i hope
you've gotten something out of it

0:14:01.070,0:14:03.040
and uh... health and human future thank
you
