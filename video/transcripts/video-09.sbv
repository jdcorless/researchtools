welcome to research tools to double oven
video nine

0:00:05.330,0:00:07.310
place on perjury

0:00:07.310,0:00:08.389
parts

0:00:08.389,0:00:10.069
manuscripts where

0:00:10.069,0:00:12.119
and i'll be talking today about

0:00:12.119,0:00:16.109
the various components that go into
writing software and

0:00:16.109,0:00:17.609
python

0:00:17.609,0:00:20.449
and we'll take a quick look at all the
pieces that go together in a certain

0:00:20.449,0:00:25.130
seen how to be able to put together a
larger software

0:00:25.130,0:00:28.579
can go ahead and create myself a
directory here nectar

0:00:28.579,0:00:32.410
video slash nine

0:00:32.410,0:00:34.990
and i'm in a copy

0:00:34.990,0:00:38.900
from my dropbox account video

0:00:38.900,0:00:40.980
nine into video

0:00:40.980,0:00:46.560
behind my working there and we'll take a
look in their pbionline

0:00:46.560,0:00:51.970
control and bring your thinking acts so
controllers control f

0:00:51.970,0:00:53.700
and we're going to

0:00:53.700,0:00:57.610
video behind

0:00:57.610,0:00:59.130
open attached file

0:00:59.130,0:01:02.740
commute shift after class up all of my

0:01:02.740,0:01:05.270
outline for this video

0:01:05.270,0:01:09.230
and we'll take a look at assignments
ours for the final thing and will start

0:01:09.230,0:01:12.750
up by python and take a look at those
assignments

0:01:12.750,0:01:14.890
so here we are in taipei form

0:01:14.890,0:01:20.990
assignments are fairly basic it's a
signing some sort of value to variable

0:01:20.990,0:01:25.940
to hear will try to hear from ones will
try dept and shipping them

0:01:25.940,0:01:28.230
so depth equals

0:01:28.230,0:01:30.179
twenty five point two

0:01:30.179,0:01:32.810
and we can say type

0:01:32.810,0:01:36.030
depth tells us that this is a floating
point

0:01:36.030,0:01:40.040
noticed though that we don't actually
have the units on them

0:01:40.040,0:01:43.520
so if you're reading cohen you have over
here

0:01:43.520,0:01:44.729
you

0:01:44.729,0:01:48.870
probably want to write things like
comments with your units on their

0:01:48.870,0:01:54.230
so that it's clear exactly what's going
on with your variable

0:01:54.230,0:01:56.030
uh... we can also set

0:01:56.030,0:01:57.580
there was to be

0:01:57.580,0:02:00.700
strengths of ship name equals

0:02:00.700,0:02:02.440
harvey

0:02:02.440,0:02:04.530
flip

0:02:04.530,0:02:08.119
now remember with python we can we say
who

0:02:08.119,0:02:10.609
toaster variables or whose

0:02:10.609,0:02:11.680
with an ass

0:02:11.680,0:02:13.659
co-star rebels in there

0:02:13.659,0:02:16.340
and if you want to get rid of where we
can say

0:02:16.340,0:02:18.049
didi allard l

0:02:18.049,0:02:19.479
soto

0:02:19.479,0:02:20.899
ship name

0:02:20.899,0:02:23.370
an alpha types clues we only have

0:02:23.370,0:02:25.599
uh... hard up from there

0:02:25.599,0:02:28.689
so it's basic assignments

0:02:28.689,0:02:30.650
and collapse that hump

0:02:30.650,0:02:34.709
and let's take a look at a important a
type called dictionaries

0:02:34.709,0:02:37.779
dictionaries are basic look-up tables

0:02:37.779,0:02:39.949
and we can say

0:02:39.949,0:02:41.309
the

0:02:41.309,0:02:42.110
ticked

0:02:42.110,0:02:44.700
equals

0:02:44.700,0:02:47.249
mccree with curly braces

0:02:47.249,0:02:49.999
we can save

0:02:49.999,0:02:52.739
cats one

0:02:52.739,0:02:54.779
nine

0:02:54.779,0:02:56.319
jets

0:02:56.319,0:03:00.579
nine

0:03:00.579,0:03:03.509
jets

0:03:03.509,0:03:07.479
and we'll get rid of my title nine

0:03:07.479,0:03:09.969
and will hit enter into it for okay

0:03:09.969,0:03:12.519
now this picture but it's a typo

0:03:12.519,0:03:17.809
paid eight untrue we're a packet d_n_c_
tea for dictionary

0:03:17.809,0:03:21.249
and in the dictionary it's a lookup
table so we can use anything that's on

0:03:21.249,0:03:24.869
the left hand side to find what's on the
right hand side

0:03:24.869,0:03:28.059
so we can say a dekhte

0:03:28.059,0:03:31.029
saurabh

0:03:31.029,0:03:33.129
and get back that it's from nine th

0:03:33.129,0:03:37.779
now we can also and keys that or not
necessarily

0:03:37.779,0:03:40.089
integers

0:03:40.089,0:03:42.809
we can say dekhte

0:03:42.809,0:03:46.029
and we can't have anything we want your
so

0:03:46.029,0:03:48.879
will say

0:03:48.879,0:03:50.109
handled it

0:03:50.109,0:03:53.359
make that returned back to us tandem

0:03:53.359,0:03:55.659
syntax right there

0:03:55.659,0:04:00.459
so square brackets with european
sponsors of the key ray here

0:04:00.459,0:04:01.309
and its value

0:04:01.309,0:04:02.739
you're sayin' to it

0:04:02.739,0:04:06.209
sinatra type edict

0:04:06.209,0:04:08.509
who use the underscore

0:04:08.509,0:04:11.369
then they want to give us the right
thing by

0:04:11.369,0:04:17.469
now we can also ask it what car keys
harshly can safely do it

0:04:17.469,0:04:19.049
keys

0:04:19.049,0:04:23.199
to return to us a list of gist of things
that make up the keys

0:04:23.199,0:04:25.969
so it's very handy let's take a look at
something that might actually be a

0:04:25.969,0:04:26.490
little bit more

0:04:26.490,0:04:27.589
warlike

0:04:27.589,0:04:29.860
something we'd use

0:04:29.860,0:04:32.970
weak and top with metta w

0:04:32.970,0:04:36.110
constant and paste this in

0:04:36.110,0:04:38.720
and so now we have calibration

0:04:38.720,0:04:40.419
parameters

0:04:40.419,0:04:43.659
and we can then say

0:04:43.659,0:04:45.220
he used

0:04:45.220,0:04:47.800
and now we have a list of our
calibration parameters that we have

0:04:47.800,0:04:48.839
around

0:04:48.839,0:04:50.129
we could say

0:04:50.129,0:04:52.810
kelleher parisian parameters

0:04:52.810,0:04:57.030
the tab is what i'm having to make it
jumped forward so fast that we can say

0:04:57.030,0:04:58.699
what's the line

0:04:58.699,0:05:00.400
of our ship

0:05:00.400,0:05:02.409
ameya back a number

0:05:02.409,0:05:03.720
so very handy

0:05:03.720,0:05:08.159
you'll probably even so often usurp rule
the papon very helpful

0:05:08.159,0:05:12.679
and so the key things are that you can
look them up with the square brackets

0:05:12.679,0:05:17.509
you can list all of them with the dot
keys practices

0:05:17.509,0:05:21.220
and you can add more keys by taking a
dictionary

0:05:21.220,0:05:25.210
and doing what looks like the look of
the pennsylvania equal to value

0:05:25.210,0:05:29.020
and i will then put it into the exchange
any value or replace insisting one that

0:05:29.020,0:05:31.440
has the same name

0:05:31.440,0:05:34.679
that's dictionaries in a quick

0:05:34.679,0:05:40.229
and now the next big feature or work on
his functions

0:05:40.229,0:05:43.720
simona slide this over to the left his
biological easier

0:05:43.720,0:05:46.340
bring their children right

0:05:46.340,0:05:48.819
so we can follow along hopeful easier

0:05:48.819,0:05:51.379
and let's go ahead in creating functions

0:05:51.379,0:05:55.479
we can say that

0:05:55.479,0:06:01.729
q parentheses amoco on

0:06:01.729,0:06:03.509
hello

0:06:03.509,0:06:09.919
press printer weights and bill kristol
since we can see type

0:06:09.919,0:06:11.389
hello

0:06:11.389,0:06:12.980
annual function to work

0:06:12.980,0:06:15.059
exactly is our function

0:06:15.059,0:06:17.239
this is basically a way to capture

0:06:17.239,0:06:20.100
groups of code to do things for you so
it's kind of a

0:06:20.100,0:06:22.919
mackerel like thing or it basically

0:06:22.919,0:06:23.969
record some

0:06:23.969,0:06:26.900
behavior you'd like to play back

0:06:26.900,0:06:28.750
so we can actually called lapd

0:06:28.750,0:06:31.509
and what you do after we uh...

0:06:31.509,0:06:33.589
with clues for a quick will say

0:06:33.589,0:06:34.749
hello

0:06:34.749,0:06:36.939
and then to print it feeds

0:06:36.939,0:06:38.070
and we're called

0:06:38.070,0:06:40.719
hello which when inside and

0:06:40.719,0:06:44.760
did what was inside so it's talking with
us so we start off the definition

0:06:44.760,0:06:48.569
and function with the ad for definition

0:06:48.569,0:06:51.569
then you have the name of your
functionary here

0:06:51.569,0:06:54.089
and this is what are you going to call
it later on

0:06:54.089,0:06:55.229
and after this

0:06:55.229,0:06:59.539
we have to print the seas right now we
don't pass anything but if you need to

0:06:59.539,0:07:02.389
give it information this is where that
goes

0:07:02.389,0:07:05.029
chemical on separate start

0:07:05.029,0:07:06.710
a_t_f_ function

0:07:06.710,0:07:08.400
member and python

0:07:08.400,0:07:11.330
but she thinks you changing blocks
there's no

0:07:11.330,0:07:13.610
parentheses around groups of code

0:07:13.610,0:07:18.949
three actually have to indent archos
like we do with the for loop

0:07:18.949,0:07:23.400
in their once were intensely we can say
some function to adjust to the prints

0:07:23.400,0:07:28.099
you could do all kinds of functions in
the city many of them

0:07:28.099,0:07:31.750
so that you're very basic function

0:07:31.750,0:07:33.530
let's go ahead and

0:07:33.530,0:07:37.739
decent people who work here because i
function dinesh you return anything

0:07:37.739,0:07:40.369
let's go ahead and grab the phone

0:07:40.369,0:07:42.009
w

0:07:42.009,0:07:44.000
he spent

0:07:44.000,0:07:45.650
and and this function

0:07:45.650,0:07:48.869
the press entered twice

0:07:48.869,0:07:50.949
we define a function call sounds big

0:07:50.949,0:07:53.139
takes no parameters

0:07:53.139,0:07:57.769
and what you're going to return to earth
something is calculating so here is

0:07:57.769,0:08:00.550
adding two numbers member turn it's back
to valium

0:08:00.550,0:08:02.909
floats go ahead and called out

0:08:02.909,0:08:04.599
three type sound

0:08:04.599,0:08:07.909
speeding

0:08:07.909,0:08:12.210
no notice that he worked in the hello we
actually got back in a string of a

0:08:12.210,0:08:16.050
printout of the screen and we didn't get
any i'll put that we can actually

0:08:16.050,0:08:17.610
keep in use

0:08:17.610,0:08:19.159
here

0:08:19.159,0:08:20.600
with the sound speed

0:08:20.600,0:08:22.530
with the returned call

0:08:22.530,0:08:24.129
we actually get

0:08:24.129,0:08:28.079
a return value if it comes back to us
that we can use so we can say

0:08:28.079,0:08:29.650
acess

0:08:29.650,0:08:33.500
this is a really bad variable that's
hard to to follow that with a sound

0:08:33.500,0:08:36.420
speed

0:08:36.420,0:08:37.330
presenter

0:08:37.330,0:08:38.269
and now

0:08:38.269,0:08:39.149
assessed

0:08:39.149,0:08:42.990
is ourselves the serotype assets

0:08:42.990,0:08:45.970
as our floating point number they got
back from that function

0:08:45.970,0:08:49.220
so this way you could be calculating all
kinds of stuff and then you can fit into

0:08:49.220,0:08:50.600
a value

0:08:50.600,0:08:52.270
that makes it a lot easier than

0:08:52.270,0:08:54.740
handling large calculations

0:08:54.740,0:08:57.150
let's try it out something that takes

0:08:57.150,0:08:59.880
a

0:08:59.880,0:09:01.950
uh... parameter to

0:09:01.950,0:09:04.350
sold to you

0:09:04.350,0:09:06.530
uh...

0:09:06.530,0:09:07.990
jets area

0:09:07.990,0:09:11.250
sis is going to a calculation for us for
a passive in

0:09:11.250,0:09:14.280
full-length

0:09:14.280,0:09:18.820
and the whipped up over area

0:09:18.820,0:09:21.660
and we're now invented and we can save

0:09:21.660,0:09:24.850
area equals

0:09:24.850,0:09:26.020
link

0:09:26.020,0:09:29.460
lines whipped and i'm doing a slightly
different notes just to break a little

0:09:29.460,0:09:31.150
more show you

0:09:31.150,0:09:35.270
a multiple one wants to return area

0:09:35.270,0:09:36.710
returned twice

0:09:36.710,0:09:39.490
answer now we can save type

0:09:39.490,0:09:40.339
jet

0:09:40.339,0:09:43.520
area

0:09:43.520,0:09:47.520
and casinos here it actually how
different the seas because i am was

0:09:47.520,0:09:51.070
leaving for up to put too many other
young

0:09:51.070,0:09:52.420
okay so

0:09:52.420,0:09:57.780
we now have a function that can
calculate areas because they get area

0:09:57.780,0:10:01.060
never ten point one time eleven point

0:10:01.060,0:10:03.680
to with people and times

0:10:03.680,0:10:08.480
so it's a common between two eleven
point to you

0:10:08.480,0:10:10.940
presenter is now

0:10:10.940,0:10:12.940
the number of it was in here

0:10:12.940,0:10:18.580
put into length taken this number eleven
point to put into words

0:10:18.580,0:10:20.130
so she goes in

0:10:20.130,0:10:23.860
inside and then use this carry equals
lifetime's work

0:10:23.860,0:10:27.030
command that return are period

0:10:27.030,0:10:31.280
so it's a basic function taking
parameters

0:10:31.280,0:10:34.910
and this is pretty nice but if you look
so far we haven't actually saved

0:10:34.910,0:10:36.750
anything so let's

0:10:36.750,0:10:37.820
actually um...

0:10:37.820,0:10:41.970
build something that we can work with a
little bit

0:10:41.970,0:10:45.530
and if you look in here we have a more
efficient function

0:10:45.530,0:10:46.930
copy that's

0:10:46.930,0:10:48.780
w

0:10:48.780,0:10:51.760
am let's call it video nine dot

0:10:51.760,0:10:54.030
pint

0:10:54.030,0:10:57.390
and the pace this in here

0:10:57.390,0:10:58.920
and what we've done

0:10:58.920,0:11:00.820
is it create a python fortune

0:11:00.820,0:11:03.060
that will import math

0:11:03.060,0:11:07.330
it will encourage had created function
call distance

0:11:07.330,0:11:08.040
hands

0:11:08.040,0:11:12.999
we commend work with that this incident
does some complicated not forest in here

0:11:12.999,0:11:16.910
so let's leave that control x control us

0:11:16.910,0:11:19.350
and if we save

0:11:19.350,0:11:22.230
imports

0:11:22.230,0:11:23.820
distance

0:11:23.820,0:11:25.830
thrissur important video

0:11:25.830,0:11:27.080
nine

0:11:27.080,0:11:31.280
we now have to do nine dot distance

0:11:31.280,0:11:33.309
and preview nine da

0:11:33.309,0:11:34.660
distance

0:11:34.660,0:11:38.090
and we can now say one come all

0:11:38.090,0:11:40.300
and four come before

0:11:40.300,0:11:43.350
and we now know the distance between
those two points

0:11:43.350,0:11:45.080
is that

0:11:45.080,0:11:46.679
it's three point six

0:11:46.679,0:11:48.790
and some change

0:11:48.790,0:11:52.480
so let's see we also have something here
that's important to know what's in that

0:11:52.480,0:11:56.850
we've actually got the string rate after
the beginning of a function

0:11:56.850,0:12:00.940
this is referred to as a dark stringer
documentation strength

0:12:00.940,0:12:04.540
and that's actually attached to the
function and can give you help when

0:12:04.540,0:12:05.110
you're

0:12:05.110,0:12:08.060
how working with his for later on

0:12:08.060,0:12:10.860
even if you've already beginning to get
help from a later on if you've forgotten

0:12:10.860,0:12:13.560
what you've been doing

0:12:13.560,0:12:14.840
if you have

0:12:14.840,0:12:18.140
tens of thousands of one's car that's
pretty she needed to so we can say

0:12:18.140,0:12:21.240
distance had a question mark

0:12:21.240,0:12:23.880
and now comes up with the basic help

0:12:23.880,0:12:27.590
this stuff is all today by pipeline
don't worry about it but here you can

0:12:27.590,0:12:28.590
see

0:12:28.590,0:12:32.120
x one more one sixty right you are
parameters

0:12:32.120,0:12:38.570
and her dark cherry here should print
out fortunately camera what code does

0:12:38.570,0:12:43.010
so this is what's called home modules
works for the build up a module of thing

0:12:43.010,0:12:46.420
ms cocco together sick if you see those
functions

0:12:46.420,0:12:49.040
and that's becomes very handy as you
know there's a whole library of

0:12:49.040,0:12:51.080
currently work with

0:12:51.080,0:12:53.190
correct or notes

0:12:53.190,0:12:54.019
and

0:12:54.019,0:12:55.790
there's another unit a

0:12:55.790,0:12:59.130
work that's called class

0:12:59.130,0:13:01.360
it's more powerful than a function

0:13:01.360,0:13:04.769
and it kinda contains the that's
basically a functional or

0:13:04.769,0:13:07.890
often referred to as a matter inside of
it

0:13:07.890,0:13:11.160
and a classic represents something

0:13:11.160,0:13:13.569
and knows how to work with it concert

0:13:13.569,0:13:15.330
briefly brings together

0:13:15.330,0:13:19.040
data and functions together into one
area that's what they can work together

0:13:19.040,0:13:21.480
and they know about each other

0:13:21.480,0:13:27.610
so let's copy at least circle class
anti-female just type it to go slow

0:13:27.610,0:13:30.250
and so it's pretty close

0:13:30.250,0:13:32.730
calls circle

0:13:32.730,0:13:33.600
and

0:13:33.600,0:13:37.140
almost all classes will now inherit from

0:13:37.140,0:13:38.669
the single project so

0:13:38.669,0:13:42.529
so really worry about this is what this
is for a class but it's always going to

0:13:42.529,0:13:43.610
be there

0:13:43.610,0:13:46.010
or something someone will be there for
you

0:13:46.010,0:13:47.360
you see that

0:13:47.360,0:13:49.040
now thurs

0:13:49.040,0:13:51.660
since special

0:13:51.660,0:13:57.060
methods that you need to know about with
classes and these tend to come

0:13:57.060,0:13:58.960
underscores

0:13:58.960,0:14:00.700
so i'm going to create

0:14:00.700,0:14:06.360
skin called and it this is what it's
called when you create a new circle

0:14:06.360,0:14:07.410
inst

0:14:07.410,0:14:08.440
this is a function

0:14:08.440,0:14:11.260
that works on them

0:14:11.260,0:14:14.940
is internet that works on a circle

0:14:14.940,0:14:18.949
self is a reference to the obvious is
being created

0:14:18.949,0:14:21.350
and reese is a parameter coming in

0:14:21.350,0:14:25.390
so we create a circle we're gonna pass
in just a radius

0:14:25.390,0:14:28.900
and what we like to do and we create a
circle who won a store that radius

0:14:28.900,0:14:31.040
commercial self

0:14:31.040,0:14:36.510
so we can only say self dot and then
some parameters for a man

0:14:36.510,0:14:39.100
to retake that really is

0:14:39.100,0:14:44.870
that's coming in as an argument can we
say that into ourself her object

0:14:44.870,0:14:48.390
and we won't be able to do something
with that object so we can create a

0:14:48.390,0:14:49.960
function

0:14:49.960,0:14:55.710
who was known as a method to consign of
that function paramedic lasts

0:14:55.710,0:14:56.500
self

0:14:56.500,0:14:57.860
colon

0:14:57.860,0:15:01.670
return two times massed up on

0:15:01.670,0:15:02.379
to renew

0:15:02.379,0:15:07.300
pyaar squared

0:15:07.300,0:15:10.989
and self dot radius doesn't work it's
fallen

0:15:10.989,0:15:16.160
we are able to know the radius that's
attached to ourself

0:15:16.160,0:15:21.230
and we can do that the power of cheese
empire r squared

0:15:21.230,0:15:22.580
and if you're feeling

0:15:22.580,0:15:24.370
little bit nervous about

0:15:24.370,0:15:27.400
precedence what happens when with the
stars

0:15:27.400,0:15:32.730
we can always protect up with an
accident pregnancies

0:15:32.730,0:15:34.650
silicon saved us

0:15:34.650,0:15:37.960
and we have another funny one pesky are

0:15:37.960,0:15:40.370
finances stringfellow

0:15:40.370,0:15:44.830
this funny function if you asked for the
summit it turn into a string

0:15:44.830,0:15:47.120
this is the method that gets called

0:15:47.120,0:15:51.660
he can be a secret whatever

0:15:51.660,0:15:55.000
so we can say whatever and if we did
that we're gonna get back whatever

0:15:55.000,0:15:59.370
whenever we have to strangle program
just minutes interesting so circle of

0:15:59.370,0:16:00.610
area

0:16:00.610,0:16:02.570
espace

0:16:02.570,0:16:07.620
p_n_g_ will add to it uh... string
representation of he self-taught

0:16:07.620,0:16:09.070
previous sold

0:16:09.070,0:16:14.850
this is going to print a circle of a man
radius

0:16:14.850,0:16:16.660
slots are still class

0:16:16.660,0:16:19.180
the ingredients in a

0:16:19.180,0:16:20.450
now perfumer rape

0:16:20.450,0:16:24.330
consider history import we also need to
do a reloaded

0:16:24.330,0:16:25.620
video

0:16:25.620,0:16:28.130
nine to be able to pull it in

0:16:28.130,0:16:29.940
now we can save video

0:16:29.940,0:16:31.760
nine

0:16:31.760,0:16:33.670
circle

0:16:33.670,0:16:36.380
and fury ten point two

0:16:36.380,0:16:38.630
and we could see in miami

0:16:38.630,0:16:41.010
circle he calls for

0:16:41.010,0:16:43.880
two-and-a-half circle with the pipe

0:16:43.880,0:16:45.400
my

0:16:45.400,0:16:47.630
circle

0:16:47.630,0:16:50.380
and it actually told us that the class

0:16:50.380,0:16:53.650
uh... type billion nine circle sources

0:16:53.650,0:16:56.710
uh... he needs

0:16:56.710,0:16:59.840
we cannot pass that circle to you

0:16:59.840,0:17:03.290
telus experience so

0:17:03.290,0:17:04.930
uh... jets

0:17:04.930,0:17:07.659
area

0:17:07.659,0:17:09.169
call that my friend

0:17:09.169,0:17:16.169
and we now know the area that circle

0:17:16.410,0:17:20.060
now of course the tribe a string
representation of not so we can say test

0:17:20.060,0:17:20.970
your

0:17:20.970,0:17:23.470
my circle

0:17:23.470,0:17:25.320
never turns us the string

0:17:25.320,0:17:27.439
circled area ten

0:17:27.439,0:17:30.990
okay temperatures should be raised two
ten point two so we could have our first

0:17:30.990,0:17:33.470
vote we say

0:17:33.470,0:17:36.440
radiance ten point two

0:17:36.440,0:17:39.940
much better and we see reload

0:17:39.940,0:17:43.169
are

0:17:43.169,0:17:44.380
video

0:17:44.380,0:17:45.320
nine

0:17:45.320,0:17:49.070
now we still have a objects we should
say del my

0:17:49.070,0:17:50.760
circle

0:17:50.760,0:17:56.160
cannonball than have to recruiter

0:17:56.160,0:17:58.960
campus yesterday or my

0:17:58.960,0:18:00.580
circle

0:18:00.580,0:18:02.220
we now have a string

0:18:02.220,0:18:04.610
that says circle of radio standpoint q

0:18:04.610,0:18:07.070
but thought better

0:18:07.070,0:18:09.530
so we have

0:18:09.530,0:18:13.070
are nice little module that consists of

0:18:13.070,0:18:15.520
a function for class

0:18:15.520,0:18:19.110
hamas actually go on september bulls
some will say

0:18:19.110,0:18:21.830
ship name equal

0:18:21.830,0:18:26.920
harvey

0:18:26.920,0:18:29.219
and let's go ahead save that

0:18:29.219,0:18:32.620
and we'll come back here in two reloaded

0:18:32.620,0:18:35.020
do you know nine

0:18:35.020,0:18:37.910
two american civilian nine period

0:18:37.910,0:18:39.210
firsthand

0:18:39.210,0:18:42.690
in your mouth everything that comes in
with

0:18:42.690,0:18:47.370
all the options is trying to learn some
of these underscores

0:18:47.370,0:18:48.560
so we've looked at the end

0:18:48.560,0:18:50.289
net green here

0:18:50.289,0:18:55.190
and we've also look at the underscore
underscores touring underscored escort

0:18:55.190,0:18:59.230
not refunded sabretech forney useful
stuff the house

0:18:59.230,0:19:01.240
game if we're looking here too

0:19:01.240,0:19:06.380
this is a far distance function right
here

0:19:06.380,0:19:10.710
when we have our ship came down here
that we've sent

0:19:10.710,0:19:15.740
pain and way back up here sort of funny
is our circle

0:19:15.740,0:19:19.480
prepare with capitals coming up before
underscores

0:19:19.480,0:19:21.800
post-trial motions and real quick

0:19:21.800,0:19:25.620
tickets a shift in and as our shipment

0:19:25.620,0:19:29.210
so that's it for this time that was the
basics of the pieces that you'll be

0:19:29.210,0:19:31.789
using to build up python code

0:19:31.789,0:19:34.740
there's lots of little details that you
know within that will flush out but

0:19:34.740,0:19:37.610
that's the overview of

0:19:37.610,0:19:41.910
setting variables and statements hand
creating functions where you can

0:19:41.910,0:19:46.830
patterson code that doesn't checkered
past skipping classes we can group

0:19:46.830,0:19:51.310
code and it together and have these
photograph or should i handle

0:19:51.310,0:19:52.970
man don't

0:19:52.970,0:19:55.160
thanks for joining anna become much more
