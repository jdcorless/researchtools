hello my name is kirsch where and
welcome to u rehearsals video twelve

0:00:07.810,0:00:11.939
this is piped on part-time the wild week

0:00:11.939,0:00:14.180
and stay in october thirteenth

0:00:14.180,0:00:18.449
being who hadn't had to sing it going
what's startup

0:00:18.449,0:00:22.799
the typewriter on show conduct thailand

0:00:22.799,0:00:25.089
and i'm gonna show you the wild

0:00:25.089,0:00:26.640
will start off with that

0:00:26.640,0:00:29.759
somewhat contrived case here

0:00:29.759,0:00:34.190
compounds equals zero to create singer
looking variable

0:00:34.190,0:00:38.690
wildcard is what's been on

0:00:38.690,0:00:39.640
abhorrent

0:00:39.640,0:00:41.120
compounds

0:00:41.120,0:00:44.460
and then all of that one

0:00:44.460,0:00:48.130
and equals plus one

0:00:48.130,0:00:49.820
center twice

0:00:49.820,0:00:52.770
and you can have our first while loop
that we can use it as an example to

0:00:52.770,0:00:54.220
figure out why don't

0:00:54.220,0:00:57.190
and i'm gonna hit you mammal bat if your

0:00:57.190,0:00:59.580
writing a while we've been your code

0:00:59.580,0:01:04.199
most likely you know i think about what
you're doing you can rewrite and a will

0:01:04.199,0:01:06.720
be in a request something

0:01:06.720,0:01:07.750
discipline

0:01:07.750,0:01:11.090
most the time that you think you might
need a while if you actually don't

0:01:11.090,0:01:14.350
i think there are times when you
definitely while but

0:01:14.350,0:01:15.530
in general

0:01:15.530,0:01:19.910
you might want to combat side australian
example of how that might be

0:01:19.910,0:01:21.119
does take a look here

0:01:21.119,0:01:22.490
this is bill while

0:01:22.490,0:01:23.770
uh...

0:01:23.770,0:01:27.100
keyword this is that they're trying to
be in a while ago

0:01:27.100,0:01:32.009
and after that we have some sort of past
boolean test to see if we're gonna keep

0:01:32.009,0:01:33.900
flipping through

0:01:33.900,0:01:35.980
and while this is true

0:01:35.980,0:01:38.970
it's gonna run anything that's in the
block down below and then that becomes

0:01:38.970,0:01:42.480
false it's gonna skip rather and bon

0:01:42.480,0:01:45.360
with the rest of your code in this case
it to stop

0:01:45.360,0:01:50.450
nicole and that morning and then you
intent like normal report spaces for

0:01:50.450,0:01:55.100
uh... your block forty print helms
commander and want to counter that they

0:01:55.100,0:01:57.240
might actually and sunday

uh... also member

0:02:30.639,0:02:35.569
this a lot more concise and once he is

programmer student

0:02:37.290,0:02:40.129
with this kind of language for a long
time are much more used to seeing

come back around

0:02:56.619,0:03:00.950
uh... hat trick to getting its exit nine
come around and i'm

0:03:00.950,0:03:06.679
united well screen cancel it

0:03:06.679,0:03:10.119
discipline works that it's not the wrong
with that but i would argue that

0:03:10.119,0:03:12.739
typically you want to do things
worldwide

0:03:12.739,0:03:15.989
discount in range

0:03:15.989,0:03:18.339
zero to hand

0:03:18.339,0:03:19.579
marie

0:03:19.579,0:03:24.399
so that's that starts at zero goes up to
date not including hand and staffed by

0:03:24.399,0:03:27.099
revert bleach function

0:03:27.099,0:03:30.680
and then you say print house

0:03:30.680,0:03:35.379
gives you exactly same results but it's
allot more compact and once you're used

0:03:35.379,0:03:35.960
to

0:03:35.960,0:03:37.759
things like range

0:03:37.759,0:03:42.199
i would argues is a little bit easier to
read it clears and had to have

0:03:42.199,0:03:47.229
for one of the stuff for and changing
excited

0:03:47.229,0:03:49.470
but this is not going to work techno

0:03:49.470,0:03:51.729
and so we decided you know

0:03:51.729,0:03:54.539
and let me show you a case where

0:03:54.539,0:03:57.749
something like a while we've actually is
pretty important and that will be

0:03:57.749,0:04:02.069
something called demands for a long
running programs

0:04:02.069,0:04:04.869
i maintain system and you carry a stash
for you

0:04:04.869,0:04:09.109
unlike without of i've heard from him

0:04:09.109,0:04:10.399
with

0:04:10.399,0:04:11.499
yes

0:04:11.499,0:04:16.970
and let's take a quick picket systems
old hippie especially pbf

0:04:16.970,0:04:20.120
listing all the processes and
systematically look here

0:04:20.120,0:04:24.429
these are processes running inside of
one acts that are doing various things

0:04:24.429,0:04:25.290
and some of it

0:04:25.290,0:04:27.020
uh... are you going to talk

0:04:27.020,0:04:30.199
we have here some system service that's
off being written in python and this

0:04:30.199,0:04:32.440
time it's going to be running around
system

0:04:32.440,0:04:36.520
watching top forty cntr and for some
background

0:04:36.520,0:04:41.270
so if you do something like that let's
go ahead and open

0:04:41.270,0:04:43.249
like mine

0:04:43.249,0:04:46.199
demand top aren't just for real

0:04:46.199,0:04:50.479
i started program and

0:04:50.479,0:04:54.199
and user being unity

0:04:54.199,0:04:57.050
their within

0:04:57.050,0:04:58.909
uh...

0:04:58.909,0:05:02.590
not through normal set-up or python
script and will say

0:05:02.590,0:05:04.469
why no

0:05:04.469,0:05:06.400
we're what we're home

0:05:06.400,0:05:10.189
this actually is designed to run forever

0:05:10.189,0:05:11.189
so-and-so

0:05:11.189,0:05:12.710
we do something otherwise

0:05:12.710,0:05:16.330
dot missus golub around and keep giving
sometimes

0:05:16.330,0:05:20.310
and let's just make up a little
arbitrary won the new just account thank

0:05:20.310,0:05:23.039
you counsel say

0:05:23.039,0:05:28.379
uh... import time this is a model
carnival games you more later remus

0:05:28.379,0:05:30.999
something from a cold

0:05:30.999,0:05:33.229
use s need

0:05:33.229,0:05:35.519

icon comports time

0:05:40.330,0:05:42.770
timed out slowly

0:05:42.770,0:05:46.579
and there it is still a execution forget
the number of seconds

0:05:46.579,0:05:47.469
and

0:05:47.469,0:05:49.000
so while true

0:05:49.000,0:05:53.439
the will have a counter account zero to
begin with

0:05:53.439,0:05:57.169
mostly accounts plus people one

0:05:57.169,0:05:58.090
and

0:05:58.090,0:05:59.110
for print

0:05:59.110,0:06:00.750
he counts

0:06:00.750,0:06:02.069
impactful

0:06:02.069,0:06:04.000
around make it a little bit more

0:06:04.000,0:06:06.909
artists are print happened what happened

0:06:06.909,0:06:12.719
and then we'll take a nap tools datetime
dot slowly

0:06:12.719,0:06:15.100
and

0:06:15.100,0:06:17.120
we don't do anything that will

0:06:17.120,0:06:18.650
just go forever

0:06:18.650,0:06:23.269
now i'm not current podes imax according
to the right on

0:06:23.269,0:06:26.409
sleeping longer and things don't do well
with

0:06:26.409,0:06:28.330
interactive

0:06:28.330,0:06:30.769
uh... tasks

0:06:30.769,0:06:34.270
by paypal mac so we'll go back to a
shell

0:06:34.270,0:06:35.389
and

0:06:35.389,0:06:37.339
uh... so

0:06:37.339,0:06:39.269
and we're going to stay

0:06:39.269,0:06:43.900
mutual plus axe to make the sex people
my gain

0:06:43.900,0:06:44.810

colors changed here

0:06:50.080,0:06:52.619
will save that for twenty min press

0:06:52.619,0:06:55.280
return

0:06:55.280,0:06:59.840
pain sweet we have our first bugger
shows the great peaks

0:06:59.840,0:07:05.530
we have a traceback she needs in this

arguments i didn't tell how long to

0:07:11.110,0:07:13.110
sleep here's tuesday

0:07:13.110,0:07:14.860
into the number of seconds

0:07:14.860,0:07:16.650
soldiers say

0:07:16.650,0:07:18.589
point you seconds

0:07:18.589,0:07:20.910
depicted with your point

0:07:20.910,0:07:22.979
seconds

0:07:22.979,0:07:26.460
and asking her to lunch let's try it
again

0:07:26.460,0:07:31.069
and here we go it's gonna keep counting
and delays by twenty seconds with you

0:07:31.069,0:07:34.169
press control c that's what this is
right here

0:07:34.169,0:07:36.479
you have that

0:07:36.479,0:07:40.580
this program will just go on forever to
london soldiers

0:07:40.580,0:07:41.639
off the coast

0:07:41.639,0:07:43.709
and if this were running in the
background

0:07:43.709,0:07:46.719
him

0:07:46.719,0:07:50.929
so that's the basic uspowerco while loop
when you write graphical interfaces or

0:07:50.929,0:07:51.780
beliefs

0:07:51.780,0:07:54.780
so graphical user interface

0:07:54.780,0:07:58.729
then that you probably want to have
something like this and in in this this

0:07:58.729,0:08:01.169
true might it be attached to stay

0:08:01.169,0:08:02.120
uh...

0:08:02.120,0:08:03.700
might say winning

0:08:03.700,0:08:05.889
equals true

0:08:05.889,0:08:08.259
while running

0:08:08.259,0:08:11.169
and then we could do something like you
know if there are some case india at the

0:08:11.169,0:08:14.029
bottom reach someone

0:08:14.029,0:08:16.689
k_c_-one equipment can figure it out

0:08:16.689,0:08:18.009
for your band

0:08:18.009,0:08:19.969
twenty

0:08:19.969,0:08:21.619
we can say running

0:08:21.619,0:08:23.299
equals faults

0:08:23.299,0:08:25.329
also back to you

0:08:25.329,0:08:27.379
bail out there as the next time that

0:08:27.379,0:08:32.270
jackets that it'll come back to top the
wild animals a

0:08:32.270,0:08:34.020
prints

0:08:34.020,0:08:39.710
mean uh...

0:08:39.710,0:08:41.860
over and

0:08:41.860,0:08:46.020
so it's going to count up to twenty and
then it should exit forest

0:08:46.020,0:08:47.560
what manager

0:08:47.560,0:08:49.390
so that works pretty well

0:08:49.390,0:08:53.050
now good to see you can you think mike
wallace is if you have a data file so

0:08:53.050,0:08:56.080
it's just concoct a little data file

0:08:56.080,0:08:59.470
was eighteen a dot

0:08:59.470,0:09:03.310
and what you might have as you might
have a bunch uh...

0:09:03.310,0:09:04.440
ascii text

0:09:04.440,0:09:09.140
headers so we can just say

0:09:09.140,0:09:11.430
warren

0:09:11.430,0:09:14.630
final

0:09:14.630,0:09:15.699
sample

0:09:15.699,0:09:18.100
junk

0:09:18.100,0:09:21.290
and then they can say you want to
through the

0:09:21.290,0:09:28.290
glamorous

0:09:28.570,0:09:30.850
we have also forty-odd

0:09:30.850,0:09:35.060
and what we could do with the could
bring a little scripted says

0:09:35.060,0:09:36.610
reading

0:09:36.610,0:09:39.730
didn't pond

0:09:39.730,0:09:45.600
create icons for tears and you've been
in the paper on board compartir

0:09:45.600,0:09:47.570
and we can say

0:09:47.570,0:09:50.810
uh... he

0:09:50.810,0:09:52.170
in new

0:09:52.170,0:09:54.920
final people

0:09:54.920,0:09:56.570
open

0:09:56.570,0:10:03.280
uh... that while we think that we
couldn't explicit

0:10:03.280,0:10:06.490
we don't have to put in the article

0:10:06.490,0:10:08.190
and we can say

0:10:08.190,0:10:10.640
uh...

0:10:10.640,0:10:14.680
line for

0:10:14.680,0:10:18.920
uh... read line

0:10:18.920,0:10:22.700
it while

0:10:22.700,0:10:26.060
blind

0:10:26.060,0:10:28.410
uh...

0:10:28.410,0:10:30.750
equals

0:10:30.750,0:10:34.610
so we're looking for a bit slow comic
characters or ask if all of us have

0:10:34.610,0:10:37.540
really wanna keep doing nothing in here

0:10:37.540,0:10:38.640
and

0:10:38.640,0:10:42.300
there's a nice little python tool to
help you do nothing called past which

0:10:42.300,0:10:43.400
will just

0:10:43.400,0:10:47.850
different colors and school loop around
until it's

0:10:47.850,0:10:51.570
those local com here stays

0:10:51.570,0:10:53.820
comments

0:10:53.820,0:10:57.710
and than what we would do that then we
can say

0:10:57.710,0:11:01.830
uh...

0:11:01.830,0:11:02.990
wong

0:11:02.990,0:11:04.860
uh...

0:11:04.860,0:11:05.810
uh...

0:11:05.810,0:11:08.520
will do while

0:11:08.520,0:11:10.460
uh...

0:11:10.460,0:11:12.530
yet for long

0:11:12.530,0:11:16.090
one

0:11:16.090,0:11:17.500
and

0:11:17.500,0:11:20.110
uh...

0:11:20.110,0:11:23.640
one

0:11:23.640,0:11:27.730
one notices dot when you got me and i'll
show you venerate you in the second

0:11:27.730,0:11:28.810
pools

0:11:28.810,0:11:31.510
write this down vacancy

0:11:31.510,0:11:34.639
let's try this script it's not going to
expect but

0:11:34.639,0:11:35.960
it's close

0:11:35.960,0:11:42.390
so in this case the wild will skip over
those and will say

0:11:42.390,0:11:43.440
i don't know

0:11:43.440,0:11:46.630
reedy penis inside each month

0:11:46.630,0:11:48.500
we'll see what happens

0:11:48.500,0:11:50.830
and it's very unhappy

0:11:50.830,0:11:53.570
and pain because we didn't keep reading

0:11:53.570,0:11:56.150
this is what i want

0:11:56.150,0:11:59.290
tools and

0:11:59.290,0:12:01.120
uh...

0:12:01.120,0:12:03.340
wall

0:12:03.340,0:12:07.730
uh... wide line

0:12:07.730,0:12:10.540
let's try that again

0:12:10.540,0:12:11.949
so it radar data

0:12:11.949,0:12:15.570
netscape matters but who knows it
actually makes this morning here so it's

0:12:15.570,0:12:16.520
tough going

0:12:16.520,0:12:18.850
not to say what you want

0:12:18.850,0:12:22.430
the new rage you quick scripture that
would you more like what i would expect

0:12:22.430,0:12:23.590
to see

0:12:23.590,0:12:24.780
with a poorly

0:12:24.780,0:12:27.460
will do

0:12:27.460,0:12:28.870
read

0:12:28.870,0:12:31.620
it for too

0:12:31.620,0:12:35.350
nimble creature you've been

0:12:35.350,0:12:36.690
propel

0:12:36.690,0:12:40.260
elseif for lion king

0:12:40.260,0:12:42.080
open

0:12:42.080,0:12:45.860
do dot patterns are final

0:12:45.860,0:12:52.740
and what we would you then they say here

0:12:52.740,0:12:55.299
this character that comic character dosh

0:12:55.299,0:12:56.430
or pound

0:12:56.430,0:12:59.340
uh... is in

0:12:59.340,0:13:01.220
wine

0:13:01.220,0:13:02.700
continued

0:13:02.700,0:13:05.030
to continue when you see that

0:13:05.030,0:13:08.990
it jumped back to top without doing
anything else that no one

0:13:08.990,0:13:11.620
uh... we've got a break and buchanan
last time

0:13:11.620,0:13:16.070
and break with jump out of the poor the
packaging in this case would

0:13:16.070,0:13:19.200
goes back at the top and won't martin
progresses

0:13:19.200,0:13:20.560
well so we could say

0:13:20.560,0:13:22.060
print line

0:13:22.060,0:13:26.020
so it's only a print on it if there
isn't discount character and act like

0:13:26.020,0:13:28.680
before

0:13:28.680,0:13:35.590
the same time so we can do the c_h_
mongols acts lupita start upon

0:13:35.590,0:13:40.050
and we can then do aliso sheldon through
nightmare

0:13:40.050,0:13:44.300
and do you remember that we see these
till the finals that is imax doing a

0:13:44.300,0:13:45.350
backup plan

0:13:45.350,0:13:47.960
but just being built on that point

0:13:47.960,0:13:50.230
let's go ahead and try to read it

0:13:50.230,0:13:55.770
gave it to jump on

0:13:55.770,0:13:58.550
unitech too much

0:13:58.550,0:14:00.510
uh...

0:14:00.510,0:14:01.900
so if if

0:14:01.900,0:14:03.650
the number sign

0:14:03.650,0:14:06.060
is in the wind continue

0:14:06.060,0:14:10.200
uh... otherwise print the wind so here
we got the first points at the moment of

0:14:10.200,0:14:12.920
mine book here

0:14:12.920,0:14:14.650
data file regards

0:14:14.650,0:14:17.430
this lines like this one

0:14:17.430,0:14:21.130
so this is a little bit more compact and
again the while loops tend to be

0:14:21.130,0:14:22.760
trickier to pull off

0:14:22.760,0:14:28.160
and uh... walked less directors which
you do it

0:14:28.160,0:14:30.750
okay because one thing i also want to
show you

0:14:30.750,0:14:33.590
and not sitcom

0:14:33.590,0:14:40.590
we're going to fight on around

0:14:41.960,0:14:44.220
what we can say is

0:14:44.220,0:14:45.699
wilson is going to be done

0:14:45.699,0:14:49.180
well

0:14:49.180,0:14:50.790
will make this a function

0:14:50.790,0:14:54.880
amanda control space over this and
there's a really kingpin here

0:14:54.880,0:14:56.710
if we do skin

0:14:56.710,0:14:58.420
region right

0:14:58.420,0:15:02.630
control see greater than it is going to
pump are prone to the right

0:15:02.630,0:15:06.200
and said i had no stipend engine for you
is very nice

0:15:06.200,0:15:07.660
source a bath

0:15:07.660,0:15:10.750
and baranidharan important repeated too

0:15:10.750,0:15:12.450
into

0:15:12.450,0:15:15.540
so that you know a special here we have

0:15:15.540,0:15:20.470
our reputed to have to ask you what we
can also important to comports read gave

0:15:20.470,0:15:21.830
it to you

0:15:21.830,0:15:24.470
nose-to-nose dash l

0:15:24.470,0:15:28.570
unionist a new trial appeared if he
wanted to see

0:15:28.570,0:15:32.490
this is now becomes an interim
languageid

0:15:32.490,0:15:35.800
when a imports a module it will actually

0:15:35.800,0:15:40.040
by compile the codes it turn into a
special form that's faster for to work

0:15:40.040,0:15:41.030
with

0:15:41.030,0:15:45.510
and right outside as the final copy once
he for compiled

0:15:45.510,0:15:49.200
so once again ordered a whole bunch of
stuff to import bash for the second time

0:15:49.200,0:15:51.180
around the table

0:15:51.180,0:15:53.440
uh... so now we have are

0:15:53.440,0:15:54.380
uh...

0:15:54.380,0:15:58.780
stuff olympia function we're not going
to import it

0:15:58.780,0:16:02.280
so we have our souls and i suppose that
doesn't mean anything very useful for us

0:16:02.280,0:16:06.140
but that gives you a sense of the wild
and my why maybe you might know one use

0:16:06.140,0:16:08.360
the wildly very often

0:16:08.360,0:16:11.010
thanks for joining and will have more
version
