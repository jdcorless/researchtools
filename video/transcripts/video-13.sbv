0:00:01.790,0:00:06.169
whole my name is scourge where and this
is a research tools video thirteen

0:00:06.169,0:00:09.909
python part six pursing g_p_s_ data

0:00:09.909,0:00:14.289
this is a part of the u_n_ h center for
coastal mission napping

0:00:14.289,0:00:18.369
join hydrographic centers high-class on

0:00:18.369,0:00:19.890
working with

0:00:19.890,0:00:22.310
all sorts of data types for science

0:00:22.310,0:00:27.119
let's let's go ahead and get started had
dig into some personnel actual data

0:00:27.119,0:00:30.679
up so that we've been building up to the
point we can really use

0:00:30.679,0:00:31.759
real data

0:00:31.759,0:00:35.470
but today we're going to do their job

0:00:35.470,0:00:40.130
so let's go ahead and get ourselves some
g_p_s_ data collected from the roof of

0:00:40.130,0:00:42.190
ccom

0:00:42.190,0:00:48.590
so i'm on the research tools web page
and then two examples

0:00:48.590,0:00:50.260
to hear examples

0:00:50.260,0:00:55.280
and i've got several log files that i've
collected from this sensor a incident

0:00:55.280,0:00:56.690
caremark

0:00:56.690,0:00:58.250
so we have on the roof

0:00:58.250,0:01:05.170
and i'm gonna control click on this and
will be save link as

0:01:05.170,0:01:11.500
hammering the go ahead and save that's
fine

0:01:11.500,0:01:15.210
all right and i've got the days
downloaded mp

0:01:15.210,0:01:18.229
we're gonna go ahead and move toward
slashed

0:01:18.229,0:01:20.010
ccom

0:01:20.010,0:01:22.040
corker working directory

0:01:22.040,0:01:27.030
and since this is the zip compressed for
happen compress it

0:01:27.030,0:01:28.740
please go ahead and take a

0:01:28.740,0:01:32.170
quick look at our data efforts on
compressed

0:01:32.170,0:01:34.900
we can do that with the commander laughs

0:01:34.900,0:01:37.060
it's pretty safe to look at it even if
it

0:01:37.060,0:01:38.830
company binary

0:01:38.830,0:01:43.560
expressed ham to complete the file name
sort of integrating hit enter here

0:01:43.560,0:01:46.520
and will see that we've log some data

0:01:46.520,0:01:48.820
this is a whole day's worth of data

0:01:48.820,0:01:49.939
uh...

0:01:49.939,0:01:52.679
let's do it dot here we've got some
comments that are

0:01:52.679,0:01:55.530
brewed in with my logfile writer

0:01:55.530,0:01:58.390
speaking through nafta ignore those

0:01:58.390,0:02:01.369
gained we're looking at me medina here

0:02:01.369,0:02:03.869
becomes starts with the dollar sign

0:02:03.869,0:02:06.900
contains typically a two letter

0:02:06.900,0:02:10.869
occur not identifier in this case g_p_s_

0:02:10.869,0:02:15.369
and then three-letter or four-letter
code saying

0:02:15.369,0:02:18.839
worked out the attack signaling to you

0:02:18.839,0:02:21.389
so the case of the g_p_s_ this would be
uh...

0:02:21.389,0:02:24.260
and transit log

0:02:24.260,0:02:26.219
t_v_a_'s our time

0:02:26.219,0:02:27.669
fields

0:02:27.669,0:02:28.449
and

0:02:28.449,0:02:33.689
r_n_d_ a system for two whether the one
we care about kids over here digi-key

0:02:33.689,0:02:38.959
gta mississippi for the most common
g_p_s_ strength

0:02:38.959,0:02:42.909
and let's see if we can find ourselves
in information on this

0:02:42.909,0:02:45.609
if we need to go for

0:02:45.609,0:02:49.139
uh... anti-g_a_t_t_

0:02:49.139,0:02:51.090
the number of links

0:02:51.090,0:02:56.009
and then to go for the g_p_s_ t
documentation

0:02:56.009,0:03:00.189
pain for you control of gta

0:03:00.189,0:03:06.269
and controlled g_e_ again until we get
to the real documentation

0:03:06.269,0:03:08.259
so here we have a car

0:03:08.259,0:03:10.559
g_g_ a string

0:03:10.559,0:03:12.020
conservatory excel

0:03:12.020,0:03:14.579
weight to those things is for

0:03:14.579,0:03:18.130
in in here we're gonna look at the
latitude

0:03:18.130,0:03:22.130
will also need to look at the north and
south it doesn't actually safety pasta

0:03:22.130,0:03:24.589
minus in the number

0:03:24.589,0:03:26.229
and then the longitude

0:03:26.229,0:03:30.229
and at least in the west

0:03:30.229,0:03:32.450
now problem

0:03:32.450,0:03:35.049
in these numbers are a little bit funky
so

0:03:35.049,0:03:36.660
they're not what we expect

0:03:36.660,0:03:42.089
in terms of being four digits here and
five digits here for that wanted to do

0:03:42.089,0:03:44.709
we'll get into that when we start person
the data

0:03:44.709,0:03:49.290
both give it a shot and take a peek at
what we have in this area

0:03:49.290,0:03:53.419
so we can with general estes he was a
narrative accuse equip of their will to

0:03:53.419,0:03:58.430
word count that shelters to see how many
lines of text with god

0:03:58.430,0:04:01.509
so it looks like we've got quite a few

0:04:01.509,0:04:04.189
we've got he heat

0:04:04.189,0:04:05.689
he hundred eighty-one

0:04:05.689,0:04:09.179
thousand lines which is quite a few

0:04:09.179,0:04:10.839
we could also do you

0:04:10.839,0:04:11.789
so if we do have

0:04:11.789,0:04:13.779
dash fifteen

0:04:13.779,0:04:16.059
barf i don't take a quick peak

0:04:16.059,0:04:20.729
if we want to break out and see what
paul masters we've gotten

0:04:20.729,0:04:25.849
we can do something like dot correct

0:04:25.849,0:04:27.650
and i want to search for

0:04:27.650,0:04:28.780
dollar sign

0:04:28.780,0:04:32.759
slash

0:04:32.759,0:04:37.189
and that's going to get rid of comments
and other junk that we don't want

0:04:37.189,0:04:38.580
ccom

0:04:38.580,0:04:41.419
and will pipe that cut

0:04:41.419,0:04:43.949
and we'll use the delimiter

0:04:43.949,0:04:47.060
com one here so dash d comma

0:04:47.060,0:04:50.600
and bring you the first day of school to
grab the first thing for them

0:04:50.600,0:04:51.569
comma

0:04:51.569,0:04:55.949
and unfortunately cokie counts from one
unlike pythons remember we can use one

0:04:55.949,0:04:58.310
for the first field

0:04:58.310,0:05:01.330
to pay for the head to see if we've got
right

0:05:01.330,0:05:03.979
and it looks like we're getting

0:05:03.979,0:05:05.759
very nicely are

0:05:05.759,0:05:06.510
fields

0:05:06.510,0:05:11.080
now we can pipe road ahead if we can put
that to you

0:05:11.080,0:05:13.849
sort dash you for unique

0:05:13.849,0:05:18.870
and it's gonna take all of that contro
close it down to the union unique set

0:05:18.870,0:05:19.960
have

0:05:19.960,0:05:21.110
messages

0:05:21.110,0:05:24.930
so let's give it a go let it run for a
second hero occurrence for all those

0:05:24.930,0:05:27.289
data

0:05:27.289,0:05:28.719
you can see here

0:05:28.719,0:05:31.599
this is our list of email messages that
we have

0:05:31.599,0:05:35.749
so that's very nice out one on the
actually carry around again remember is

0:05:35.749,0:05:37.499
thirty pgs yay

0:05:37.499,0:05:43.190
so let's try and see how many of those
we have g_p_ gta

0:05:43.190,0:05:44.009
handle

0:05:44.009,0:05:49.160
pipette to wordcount national to count
the number of lines

0:05:49.160,0:05:53.970
hint we have a much more manageable
sixty eight thousand

0:05:53.970,0:05:59.059
so let's go ahead and and work on some
python code to parks that

0:05:59.059,0:06:00.929
idoc

0:06:00.929,0:06:03.030
handles for taipei taiwan

0:06:03.030,0:06:05.970
dash dash pile of to applauding

0:06:05.970,0:06:07.809
presenter

0:06:07.809,0:06:11.350
and more now rates you start looking at
her file

0:06:11.350,0:06:15.160
so what we can do is we can start to
create some scripts and their open up

0:06:15.160,0:06:18.800
and he max here don't go into video

0:06:18.800,0:06:20.639
thirteen

0:06:20.639,0:06:24.090
so there's our directory without and
will say

0:06:24.090,0:06:28.330
w x one dot but i will be our first
scripts for those control x control

0:06:28.330,0:06:29.849
after open

0:06:29.849,0:06:30.939
santer

0:06:30.939,0:06:33.619
if you file so prone bang

0:06:33.619,0:06:39.229
usurping indy python for typical
personal i don't

0:06:39.229,0:06:43.459
in let's go ahead and open the file and
just the through that it'll say four

0:06:43.459,0:06:45.459
wind and

0:06:45.459,0:06:47.019
costumes

0:06:47.019,0:06:49.929
and or filers

0:06:49.929,0:06:55.169
here we've got cars parents poll
copycats

0:06:55.169,0:06:56.560
copy

0:06:56.560,0:06:57.389
and

0:06:57.389,0:07:00.940
old wine here to paste

0:07:00.940,0:07:01.979
and then

0:07:01.979,0:07:04.259
we can say uh...

0:07:04.259,0:07:07.030
print weingarten we want to do that

0:07:07.030,0:07:09.719
before we can cube

0:07:09.719,0:07:12.779
opr first uh... went through it

0:07:12.779,0:07:16.159
we're just a tech perhaps

0:07:16.159,0:07:19.120
this is the no operation in python

0:07:19.120,0:07:21.590
it's just a placeholder really don't
have anything you want to have a

0:07:21.590,0:07:23.039
national saved

0:07:23.039,0:07:23.839
run

0:07:23.839,0:07:26.069
review acts one

0:07:26.069,0:07:28.269
and it runs pretty quick

0:07:28.269,0:07:31.479
what's actually chemist telephone lines

0:07:31.479,0:07:32.889
so will say

0:07:32.889,0:07:34.319
school

0:07:34.319,0:07:37.219
lines

0:07:37.219,0:07:39.669
equals zero

0:07:39.669,0:07:43.460
in every time we had a line won't add
one thing that uh... total

0:07:43.460,0:07:45.240
blind what

0:07:45.240,0:07:48.240
treated at a coherent lines

0:07:48.240,0:07:51.580
and remember that what he calls pads

0:07:51.580,0:07:52.319
uh... some

0:07:52.319,0:07:55.889
and half the comes up decal signs too
that variable

0:07:55.889,0:08:02.149
so it's pretty income advocates adding a
twist and one's time through

0:08:02.149,0:08:05.679
we don't hear passing morsel control
case to collapse

0:08:05.679,0:08:07.259
and we can print

0:08:07.259,0:08:07.990
total

0:08:07.990,0:08:09.969
winds

0:08:09.969,0:08:11.169
colon

0:08:11.169,0:08:13.060
hand santo

0:08:13.060,0:08:14.699
oral

0:08:14.699,0:08:16.550
lines

0:08:16.550,0:08:19.059
say that controllers controller us

0:08:19.059,0:08:21.129
military run it

0:08:21.129,0:08:25.319
so is it straight through enemy
territory kita

0:08:25.319,0:08:29.509
eight hundred eighty eight thousand
winds of three hundred eighty one

0:08:29.509,0:08:30.229
and

0:08:30.229,0:08:34.839
what we need to know is take a look to
see if we can only look for the d_g_a_

0:08:34.839,0:08:38.350
lawrence phillips iii of disintegrated
that preform

0:08:38.350,0:08:39.860
sold to you

0:08:39.860,0:08:40.610
rittick bow

0:08:40.610,0:08:45.410
ang will issue running the show command
schools they head

0:08:45.410,0:08:49.420
secom now tab also works for testing
here it's will to

0:08:49.420,0:08:50.940
bang hand

0:08:50.940,0:08:55.830
he knew you had a few more months
website dash fifteen

0:08:55.830,0:08:58.770
and so if we see we have

0:08:58.770,0:09:00.960
party pgc eight

0:09:00.960,0:09:04.940
so let's go ahead and corey

0:09:04.940,0:09:06.540
stupid copy

0:09:06.540,0:09:08.550
expand and will say

0:09:08.550,0:09:09.860
contest line

0:09:09.860,0:09:14.240
for just a crater self-confessed at it

0:09:14.240,0:09:17.140
so now we have one line that we can work
with

0:09:17.140,0:09:19.890
and we can save lined underlying factor

0:09:19.890,0:09:23.150
and we can try it out and see if we can

0:09:23.150,0:09:26.910
find out if we could pass for something
in that

0:09:26.910,0:09:32.720
seen this before a class a_ g_ g_ a week
at the is g_g_ aitken line

0:09:32.720,0:09:36.430
it's true more interesting thing else
like the

0:09:36.430,0:09:38.430
and debbie key string

0:09:38.430,0:09:40.100
that's not in there

0:09:40.100,0:09:45.300
and if we had

0:09:45.300,0:09:48.110
so it's gone forever twenty one that we
don't want

0:09:48.110,0:09:49.910
copycat sky

0:09:49.910,0:09:51.630
kit

0:09:51.630,0:09:53.350
copied

0:09:53.350,0:09:55.100
paste

0:09:55.100,0:09:56.580
we can say

0:09:56.580,0:10:00.600
is g_g_ in

0:10:00.600,0:10:01.650
nope

0:10:01.650,0:10:04.170
ashes

0:10:04.170,0:10:06.790
country the injunction yes

0:10:06.790,0:10:10.230
so now we have a nice to have to see if
something's

0:10:10.230,0:10:12.700
college aged not mine

0:10:12.700,0:10:19.700
so what we can do with we can say

0:10:19.710,0:10:22.090
g_g_ aidid

0:10:22.090,0:10:23.890
not in

0:10:23.890,0:10:24.990
twine

0:10:24.990,0:10:29.030
knows what's the sense of what's going
on here so let's try that

0:10:29.030,0:10:33.050
will say gta him line

0:10:33.050,0:10:37.410
yes we say not inline hates false

0:10:37.410,0:10:43.220
and they can say

0:10:43.220,0:10:48.520
and paint and that we don't have g g
eight wind that will return true

0:10:48.520,0:10:50.000
wants to use that

0:10:50.000,0:10:53.860
and we use that continue that we talked
about briefly before

0:10:53.860,0:10:55.200
so when you get

0:10:55.200,0:11:00.060
here's this will be true and there's no
gta will go into this continue will jump

0:11:00.060,0:11:04.100
up since four lupin skipping the code
that we have afterwards

0:11:04.100,0:11:06.340
so what will do with will say

0:11:06.340,0:11:10.100
total g_a_t_t_ quote zero we'll have a
moral

0:11:10.100,0:11:12.120
code will counter

0:11:12.120,0:11:13.750
and we can say

0:11:13.750,0:11:16.589
total t_g_a_ popsicles

0:11:16.589,0:11:18.319
one because it's free

0:11:18.319,0:11:20.970
having continued to meet you have it
easy and

0:11:20.970,0:11:22.820
could save dot

0:11:22.820,0:11:27.040
muscat petrescu run w x one

0:11:27.040,0:11:29.300
came to have my first bug

0:11:29.300,0:11:32.790
i forgot actually have interpreted
points no prints

0:11:32.790,0:11:34.000
total

0:11:34.000,0:11:36.440

totals

0:11:38.350,0:11:40.950
gtv

0:11:40.950,0:11:44.300
now we can't go ahead and on that

0:11:44.300,0:11:47.799
and now we have a car total lines and
article twenty two years

0:11:47.799,0:11:49.550
very nice

0:11:49.550,0:11:52.070
so that's the beginning pursing her care

0:11:52.070,0:11:55.980
could not able to separate out the
teaching law anti-g_a_t_t_

0:11:55.980,0:12:00.300
g_p_s_ wants from everything else we
need to start being able to pursue so

0:12:00.300,0:12:02.390
recovery if we typed

0:12:02.390,0:12:03.580
foods

0:12:03.580,0:12:05.420
we'd get

0:12:05.420,0:12:06.800
all of our

0:12:06.800,0:12:09.260
stuff if we save line

0:12:09.260,0:12:12.120
comparably reliant lost what we want
them

0:12:12.120,0:12:14.540
so we can do

0:12:14.540,0:12:18.230
a reverse search control or frontline

0:12:18.230,0:12:23.040
church baxter kids keeping control are
to get back to your previous comments

0:12:23.040,0:12:26.769
and this is the line actually want to
reset exquisite answer

0:12:26.769,0:12:29.430
and we're not tycoons

0:12:29.430,0:12:33.750
and now arlyne actually have a statement

0:12:33.750,0:12:36.490
so the way we can play with wine

0:12:36.490,0:12:38.400
interviews to see the wind

0:12:38.400,0:12:43.110
is it's broken up by commons so here is
one of our fields we care about that

0:12:43.110,0:12:45.080
started latitude

0:12:45.080,0:12:46.220
and and and

0:12:46.220,0:12:49.410
the north component of our thirteen in
here start

0:12:49.410,0:12:50.550
longitude

0:12:50.550,0:12:52.700
as west noticed that

0:12:52.700,0:12:54.170
typically in

0:12:54.170,0:12:57.380
the united states her longitude star
minus

0:12:57.380,0:13:01.330
figure they've written as well so that i
have to combine that together

0:13:01.330,0:13:04.190
so we can split this apart

0:13:04.190,0:13:06.950
on commerce

0:13:06.950,0:13:10.770
and that will give us a decade leg up in
terms of working with the state a

0:13:10.770,0:13:13.500
and so you can see this is field zero

0:13:13.500,0:13:15.290
field one

0:13:15.290,0:13:18.670
feel to so are allowed to that she can
be field two

0:13:18.670,0:13:22.760
so feel old

0:13:22.760,0:13:26.150
groups fields pearl

0:13:26.150,0:13:33.150
and he actually received very well first
sophie yields equals windup split column

0:13:33.150,0:13:35.620
screamed

0:13:35.620,0:13:37.140
whose

0:13:37.140,0:13:37.920
now we

0:13:37.920,0:13:42.880
have fields sizzler list of all time
stuff when we can say fields

0:13:42.880,0:13:43.860
too

0:13:43.860,0:13:47.290
and that's our latitude so this is just
a string that we still need to work with

0:13:47.290,0:13:48.500
this

0:13:48.500,0:13:52.290
to make it into a number of its a
decimal degrees

0:13:52.290,0:13:54.069
and our first problem is that

0:13:54.069,0:13:59.430
here we've got forty three years are at
your portion have latitude

0:13:59.430,0:14:03.010
but they've gone and they've has put
that off kinda funny so what we can do

0:14:03.010,0:14:05.850
is we can say field said too

0:14:05.850,0:14:09.000
and we could take just the first two
characters

0:14:09.000,0:14:12.730
preceptor and that gives us just our
forty-three now we want to convert that

0:14:12.730,0:14:15.510
to number so we see into

0:14:15.510,0:14:19.940
and that gives us our first component
now have to do with the second part

0:14:19.940,0:14:23.180
and i'm just going to go ahead and tell
you because it's not obvious in their

0:14:23.180,0:14:24.950
documentation

0:14:24.950,0:14:27.770
and you don't really want to spend
several hundred dollars for the team a

0:14:27.770,0:14:29.250
documentation

0:14:29.250,0:14:33.190
but if you read their documentation it's
not clear that this is actually

0:14:33.190,0:14:36.770
degree decimal degrees but actually it
is

0:14:36.770,0:14:38.190
so will go ahead and

0:14:38.190,0:14:41.690
will turn that into a number that we can
use

0:14:41.690,0:14:43.529
source for both with fields

0:14:43.529,0:14:46.030
too

0:14:46.030,0:14:50.630
patricia henry here this is good start
from to go on

0:14:50.630,0:14:53.960
school say to kawan

0:14:53.960,0:14:56.150
and that gives us the rest

0:14:56.150,0:15:01.270
so now we can say float because issue
nikita dot small portion lamp

0:15:01.270,0:15:05.600
and that gives us died eskimo degrees

0:15:05.600,0:15:11.600
and if we divide that by sixty that will
give us the actual

0:15:11.600,0:15:13.750
there sorry this is the best moments

0:15:13.750,0:15:18.340
right here who have gotten into color
thirty degrees divide by fifty

0:15:18.340,0:15:20.390
presenter

0:15:20.390,0:15:23.780
that will be the part that we need to
add together so let's go ahead and

0:15:23.780,0:15:26.970
combine are two portions so we have

0:15:26.970,0:15:29.250
the twenty nine one appeared

0:15:29.250,0:15:32.170
well see

0:15:32.170,0:15:34.850
fields to the intern

0:15:34.850,0:15:38.160
and groups were add to that

0:15:38.160,0:15:45.160
this parade here which is

0:15:47.590,0:15:50.720
in decorate their is

0:15:50.720,0:15:53.190
are latitude

0:15:53.190,0:15:57.020
look ok but it does work so let's go
ahead and can start adding that came to

0:15:57.020,0:16:00.200
our script over in the right to prevent
what happened

0:16:00.200,0:16:04.440
as we've looked through

0:16:04.440,0:16:10.830
let's go ahead and say field speak walls
line doubts bullet

0:16:10.830,0:16:12.910
if this deal that we want to

0:16:12.910,0:16:19.650
and now we can say

0:16:19.650,0:16:21.740
copy

0:16:21.740,0:16:25.110
uh... thank you

0:16:25.110,0:16:27.880
analysts say that too

0:16:27.880,0:16:30.800
bahrisons remember that

0:16:30.800,0:16:32.860
latitude

0:16:32.860,0:16:35.430
why

0:16:35.430,0:16:39.480
sewing mathematically is a tax why the
people state latin come along and you'll

0:16:39.480,0:16:42.150
see that terrifically if they don't

0:16:42.150,0:16:44.370
now the next thing if we typed

0:16:44.370,0:16:48.510
fields remember that we have to look at
this north south to see if were in the

0:16:48.510,0:16:53.850
northern hemisphere so the hemisphere
and changed the sign of are allowed to

0:16:53.850,0:16:55.500
so we can say if

0:16:55.500,0:16:56.970
fields

0:16:56.970,0:17:00.390
the reason that's the next one

0:17:00.390,0:17:02.240
equals

0:17:02.240,0:17:03.620
self

0:17:03.620,0:17:06.780
then that we're gonna wanna make that
signed change

0:17:06.780,0:17:10.380
to be the opposites with tiwari equals
minus white-knuckle flip it to be

0:17:10.380,0:17:12.590
negative

0:17:12.590,0:17:14.530
so that's part latitude

0:17:14.530,0:17:17.250
and let's try a few of those

0:17:17.250,0:17:24.250
he and hammered use a quick trick up
here if we say kitten numerator

0:17:24.440,0:17:27.280
what that will do is every time we go
through a line and will return

0:17:27.280,0:17:29.150
earn another variable type

0:17:29.150,0:17:32.799
is the line number to go with them

0:17:32.799,0:17:36.190
and we can say if line

0:17:36.190,0:17:37.970
creative and

0:17:37.970,0:17:41.230
pro will just pick something like fifty

0:17:41.230,0:17:43.230
and we'll see

0:17:43.230,0:17:46.690
fabric is a little bit different than
continue so continue which ends at the

0:17:46.690,0:17:48.530
top when it gets called

0:17:48.530,0:17:51.890
break flaxseed get out of the
four-legged and get on the bottom get

0:17:51.890,0:17:53.130
out of it

0:17:53.130,0:17:54.260
source a

0:17:54.260,0:17:56.450
if one number is greater than fifty

0:17:56.450,0:18:01.530
will call break and that will drop
esteban down here past arco

0:18:01.530,0:18:06.120
and then we're going to our legal
protection for them

0:18:06.120,0:18:09.510
sources go ahead and see if we can run
the school find out if we have any bugs

0:18:09.510,0:18:10.850
so run

0:18:10.850,0:18:14.419
too few x wanda party

0:18:14.419,0:18:16.380
and it looks like it goes ok

0:18:16.380,0:18:19.110
and there is now here we've only gone
through

0:18:19.110,0:18:20.960
uh... fifty-one lines

0:18:20.960,0:18:22.000
kenyans

0:18:22.000,0:18:24.650
uh... fortier's

0:18:24.650,0:18:27.350
let's go ahead and print up the water
make sure it's working

0:18:27.350,0:18:29.720
schools

0:18:29.720,0:18:32.700
why give ourselves a contest

0:18:32.700,0:18:34.580
and the go ahead and run down again

0:18:34.580,0:18:36.840
in the sierra y_ startin to print out
here

0:18:36.840,0:18:38.550
for next week

0:18:38.550,0:18:41.450
so now we can do the same thing for my
team

0:18:41.450,0:18:46.480
sticker volunteered to do in their lives
he saved fuels

0:18:46.480,0:18:47.910
fields

0:18:47.910,0:18:49.910
into this was

0:18:49.910,0:18:51.800
field too

0:18:51.800,0:18:52.580
field

0:18:52.580,0:18:56.429
torii endfield for got that right

0:18:56.429,0:18:59.260
fields

0:18:59.260,0:19:01.260
emily to split this up again

0:19:01.260,0:19:02.750
and this time

0:19:02.750,0:19:08.740
we have both seven zero is our attitude
effective direct ext

0:19:08.740,0:19:12.150
we can say colon

0:19:12.150,0:19:15.590
so zero one to and that's probably what

0:19:15.590,0:19:19.039
re every dome

0:19:19.039,0:19:21.490
vertigo one past the one that you want

0:19:21.490,0:19:25.389
and we can say integer arafat and that
will give us seventy

0:19:25.389,0:19:29.460
we can do the same thing with that
trillium portions of fields

0:19:29.460,0:19:31.620
for

0:19:31.620,0:19:35.110
and we can go from divert the third
position

0:19:35.110,0:19:37.310
skip zero one too

0:19:37.310,0:19:39.279
anger at the end by leaving out

0:19:39.279,0:19:40.559
but sitting here

0:19:40.559,0:19:41.289
scorn

0:19:41.289,0:19:42.249
presenter

0:19:42.249,0:19:44.470
so there's the rest of that

0:19:44.470,0:19:46.609
patrolling live at the beginning

0:19:46.609,0:19:48.880
float

0:19:48.880,0:19:51.390
floating point number and we need to
convert that

0:19:51.390,0:19:56.130
from decimal management two degrees who
divide by sixteen th

0:19:56.130,0:19:57.629
so that's of

0:19:57.629,0:20:01.390
training component and then we could
combine the two together

0:20:01.390,0:20:04.429
planetary dot one it related beginning

0:20:04.429,0:20:05.780
will go go round

0:20:05.780,0:20:08.590
this guy

0:20:08.590,0:20:12.590
copy sheet

0:20:12.590,0:20:14.320
have the two together

0:20:14.320,0:20:18.790
and there were a couple attitude terror
munchkin

0:20:18.790,0:20:20.750
surrender and copy of this

0:20:20.750,0:20:21.570
it

0:20:21.570,0:20:23.610
copy looks pretty good

0:20:23.610,0:20:24.960
him will go ahead

0:20:24.960,0:20:26.900
type acts equals

0:20:26.900,0:20:29.549
command control wide paste

0:20:29.549,0:20:33.640
there looks pretty good now remember we
also have to worry about east and west

0:20:33.640,0:20:36.950
european don't have a great time

0:20:36.950,0:20:39.460
so will go ahead and say if

0:20:39.460,0:20:42.510
fields and an expanding number five

0:20:42.510,0:20:43.940
he calls

0:20:43.940,0:20:46.070
west

0:20:46.070,0:20:48.000
then we'll say act sequels

0:20:48.000,0:20:50.610
negative

0:20:50.610,0:20:53.610
let's get rid of printing everything
like that

0:20:53.610,0:20:56.029
animal prints

0:20:56.029,0:20:58.120
prince acts come watch

0:20:58.120,0:21:01.560
that looks pretty good to me wants to
give it a shot and see if we get some

0:21:01.560,0:21:03.770
nice corning stock

0:21:03.770,0:21:07.490
and will say

0:21:07.490,0:21:10.980
sometimes to get there isn't the most
efficient

0:21:10.980,0:21:15.250
and we've now got pax and y

0:21:15.250,0:21:19.350
and if you go verify that plotted the
coup colors or sounds cool like that car

0:21:19.350,0:21:23.480
into a map to and you'll see that this
is the actual location of the secom

0:21:23.480,0:21:25.320
building

0:21:25.320,0:21:28.910
so that's pretty nice we've got
ourselves a good scripts to personal

0:21:28.910,0:21:30.529
data

0:21:30.529,0:21:31.929
and

0:21:31.929,0:21:33.859
without let's go ahead and

0:21:33.859,0:21:37.650
write this to a new farm or go ahead and
work on plotting

0:21:37.650,0:21:39.270

0:21:39.270,0:21:44.299
w is right soccer shorts control w sorry

0:21:44.299,0:21:47.500
and that or if it's a w x

0:21:47.500,0:21:49.929
too

0:21:49.929,0:21:53.540
and we wanted you know it's convert this
into something that we can actually uses

0:21:53.540,0:21:57.220
the function ticket the data back into
i'd take a break here

0:21:57.220,0:21:59.419
said we can't use it

0:21:59.419,0:22:02.590
so it's things that we don't really need
are total rentals

0:22:02.590,0:22:04.450
let's get rid of that

0:22:04.450,0:22:07.040
we're not going to want do

0:22:07.040,0:22:10.230
keepers just a few moments we'll get rid
of the sky

0:22:10.230,0:22:14.990
moroccan account alliance we are going
to just get the gta

0:22:14.990,0:22:18.490
an american count them

0:22:18.490,0:22:21.140
or or comment really need that

0:22:21.140,0:22:24.160
kenyans we don't want to print

0:22:24.160,0:22:26.299
nor do we need to print the total

0:22:26.299,0:22:29.680
so now we've got ourselves a little bit
simpler code to work with

0:22:29.680,0:22:33.080
international function that will return

0:22:33.080,0:22:34.820
to lists

0:22:34.820,0:22:37.919
and those lists will each be taxed on
the line

0:22:37.919,0:22:38.650
so let's go

0:22:38.650,0:22:44.150
overhead and create a functions will say

0:22:44.150,0:22:45.980
g_g_

0:22:45.980,0:22:48.550
file name

0:22:48.550,0:22:50.330
saturday function

0:22:50.330,0:22:54.460
we can put a dark string hearings says
parts nina

0:22:54.460,0:22:56.690
gta g_p_s_

0:22:56.690,0:23:00.049
positions

0:23:00.049,0:23:00.980
looks good

0:23:00.980,0:23:06.190
and melanie to intent that this section
grades here and placed on handsome

0:23:06.190,0:23:09.840
sarra sorry imax has some nice place to
do that so

0:23:09.840,0:23:12.809
over here we have shift region left and
right so

0:23:12.809,0:23:17.420
controls the and angry and mostly to the
right

0:23:17.420,0:23:18.390
picked up

0:23:18.390,0:23:19.720
and that was invented

0:23:19.720,0:23:25.070
four spaces great extra life a lot
easier time to get everything

0:23:25.070,0:23:27.390
alice crater sells too

0:23:27.390,0:23:29.820
parades so will say

0:23:29.820,0:23:31.140
perilous

0:23:31.140,0:23:32.890
salsa acts list

0:23:32.890,0:23:35.040
testicles and different things

0:23:35.040,0:23:37.060
and make it empty

0:23:37.060,0:23:38.299
nothing in there

0:23:38.299,0:23:41.130
whitelist

0:23:41.130,0:23:44.060
and what where do these come through
this for a loop we're going to go ahead

0:23:44.060,0:23:49.450
and up and down onto the end simply save
them so will say

0:23:49.450,0:23:54.140
okay let's see texts list dot and

0:23:54.140,0:23:55.710
uh... and the

0:23:55.710,0:23:57.510
acts on there

0:23:57.510,0:24:03.480
and why list apparent

0:24:03.480,0:24:04.550
say that

0:24:04.550,0:24:07.859
into i definitely have some bugs running
around here one is

0:24:07.859,0:24:10.710
we've heard coder file name so we're
gonna

0:24:10.710,0:24:14.670
felipe bits of controlled w config file
name

0:24:14.670,0:24:18.170
so now we have a little bit more
flexible function

0:24:18.170,0:24:22.290
inputs give it a shot and see what
happens so we'll go over here at and

0:24:22.290,0:24:23.419
will stay

0:24:23.419,0:24:24.740
import

0:24:24.740,0:24:26.990
give you x_ too

0:24:26.990,0:24:30.830
head import okay that's pretty nice that
that the x_-two

0:24:30.830,0:24:34.480
period pressed tab to dot

0:24:34.480,0:24:39.030
before friction called loaded g_-eight
ask for some help

0:24:39.030,0:24:41.620
person email ok looks pretty giren

0:24:41.620,0:24:43.940
let's see if we can't call it

0:24:43.940,0:24:47.309
and if we need and single quote can seek

0:24:47.309,0:24:49.220
compress to happen

0:24:49.220,0:24:50.410
complete

0:24:50.410,0:24:52.279
and see if this works

0:24:52.279,0:24:56.539
and three-way and nothing happens what
to do coups

0:24:56.539,0:24:59.690
uh... not exchange we have a good idea

0:24:59.690,0:25:01.149
what could be wrong

0:25:01.149,0:25:06.120
well with functions if you don't
actually pass anything back in a return

0:25:06.120,0:25:06.820
dancing

0:25:06.820,0:25:10.620
function exist only while that functions
learning so once you come into this

0:25:10.620,0:25:13.090
function

0:25:13.090,0:25:15.080
texts listed wireless to quote

0:25:15.080,0:25:16.320
will be treated here

0:25:16.320,0:25:19.739
and we drop off the bottom they'll get
deleted neva gone

0:25:19.739,0:25:24.530
they only exist inside of this functions
are called local variables

0:25:24.530,0:25:28.820
so we need to return them back so that
we can use them begins the return

0:25:28.820,0:25:30.020
excellence

0:25:30.020,0:25:31.120
comox

0:25:31.120,0:25:32.710
wireless

0:25:32.710,0:25:35.539
i thought was pretty clever

0:25:35.539,0:25:39.570
if you pass back a list of things he'll
come back to me turn into a listener

0:25:39.570,0:25:40.720
matically

0:25:40.720,0:25:44.170
and if you have multiple variables that
your son your two songs at the same

0:25:44.170,0:25:45.690
number of things

0:25:45.690,0:25:48.750
well swine very nicely so we can say

0:25:48.750,0:25:54.410
caringbridge reloaded but we have this
interview next to you

0:25:54.410,0:25:58.370
finale proved that new code that we see
different here to make sure that there's

0:25:58.370,0:26:01.480
no stars in here when you do not

0:26:01.480,0:26:04.419
and we'll go ahead and say

0:26:04.419,0:26:08.299
w x to actually knew what was that the
other get there

0:26:08.299,0:26:09.140
pains

0:26:09.140,0:26:11.200
pressed enter

0:26:11.200,0:26:12.620
payloads data

0:26:12.620,0:26:15.100
paint we got

0:26:15.100,0:26:20.420
not what we want to back meat a scott
two items

0:26:20.420,0:26:22.570
and what happened here

0:26:22.570,0:26:26.289
export xd

0:26:26.289,0:26:28.890
him

0:26:28.890,0:26:31.150
school say print

0:26:31.150,0:26:32.590
blanks

0:26:32.590,0:26:37.220
pics listed see how big the system to
give their children to do something here

0:26:37.220,0:26:39.940
i'm not actually sure whats wrong school
too

0:26:39.940,0:26:41.620
reload

0:26:41.620,0:26:44.650
family right

0:26:44.650,0:26:50.399
and it didn't depend anything looks like
so excellence to patent was dependent

0:26:50.399,0:26:52.890
what could be doing wrong

0:26:52.890,0:26:55.470
excludes repentant acts

0:26:55.470,0:26:57.429
and if you notice here

0:26:57.429,0:27:00.550
and now it's part of my blog i'd come
through the loop

0:27:00.550,0:27:03.280
handed him back up there i didn't
actually say that we need to you

0:27:03.280,0:27:05.759
actually in ten states into you

0:27:05.759,0:27:08.190
that block psychic abt

0:27:08.190,0:27:11.980
and and and will match that's based
loosely dropped through the different

0:27:11.980,0:27:15.210
content ations

0:27:15.210,0:27:17.120
levinson backspace there

0:27:17.120,0:27:22.260
so stressed again and record you kill
that since i think schoolwork

0:27:22.260,0:27:24.820
and will reload it and try again

0:27:24.820,0:27:26.230
that was a little

0:27:26.230,0:27:28.340
and abundant

0:27:28.340,0:27:30.870
to load the data

0:27:30.870,0:27:32.150
weight

0:27:32.150,0:27:36.649
it's working and well look at that
that's a lot of the year

0:27:36.649,0:27:41.310
so hopefully that'll fair sometime soon

0:27:41.310,0:27:48.310
as a way for to go to school and my way
too fast

0:27:48.320,0:27:52.470
so we want to say that in to keep their
whole soliciting acts come online

0:27:52.470,0:27:53.529
they remember

0:27:53.529,0:27:58.779
exco why here has absolutely nothing to
do with ex-wife overhear this is inside

0:27:58.779,0:28:00.009
of the function

0:28:00.009,0:28:03.200
and to somewhere else so that they're
not really a m

0:28:03.200,0:28:06.120
score i hadn't had answered

0:28:06.120,0:28:08.920
and we can print

0:28:08.920,0:28:11.630
buses to link to tax and see what you
got

0:28:11.630,0:28:14.340
looks pretty good print acts

0:28:14.340,0:28:17.230
and there's a lot of stuff going on the
screen

0:28:17.230,0:28:19.190
not very useful to look at the like that

0:28:19.190,0:28:23.120
perhaps to be better to plop them so
it's a plots

0:28:23.120,0:28:26.659
ex-con wine

0:28:26.659,0:28:28.020
we'll look at that

0:28:28.020,0:28:32.550
here is or g_p_s_ data no records are
very useful

0:28:32.550,0:28:38.140
but that shows you the g_p_s_ wander
over a day for station

0:28:38.140,0:28:41.660
so that actually can tell us something
about the accuracy for g_p_s_ and one

0:28:41.660,0:28:42.460
time

0:28:42.460,0:28:46.090
and we can also use that to get a very
accurate history of the actual cash

0:28:46.090,0:28:50.390
member g_p_s_ has now fervor building

0:28:50.390,0:28:51.789
so that's pretty handy

0:28:51.789,0:28:56.160
and we can also do some quick checks we
can say amperage

0:28:56.160,0:28:57.559
contracts

0:28:57.559,0:28:59.400
and amperage

0:28:59.400,0:29:00.570
why

0:29:00.570,0:29:04.620
and that's now a pretty good estimate of
the location of our weather center in

0:29:04.620,0:29:06.280
the referred the building

0:29:06.280,0:29:10.490
so that's it for this time and next time
we're going to hopefully some protection

0:29:10.490,0:29:14.720
worked her most recent distances and
calculations with

0:29:14.720,0:29:16.610
statistical estimates

0:29:16.610,0:29:19.789
and that's your first taste really
person to death

0:29:19.789,0:29:21.090
and uh...

0:29:21.090,0:29:23.810
there's lots of different versions
online and we'll see a good number of

0:29:23.810,0:29:25.250
them but with so that you started
