hello my name is kirsch where and this
is research tools video seventeen

0:00:06.720,0:00:10.469
jalan talking today about imax queer
plates

0:00:10.469,0:00:12.940
each d_f_a_ files with bags

0:00:12.940,0:00:15.439
and x_ amount no data

0:00:15.439,0:00:20.539
today this is for the u_n_ agency com jc

0:00:20.539,0:00:22.460
research tools course

0:00:22.460,0:00:24.369
and let's get into it

0:00:24.369,0:00:28.109
so start off by downloading a bag and a
half of my website

0:00:28.109,0:00:30.230
accuse anyone from the ela

0:00:30.230,0:00:35.030
uh... angie d_c_ archive or any other
source of bags

0:00:35.030,0:00:39.720
so you're amazing today do you get
command to grab that from my webserver

0:00:39.720,0:00:42.910
will need to uncompressed who could you
file

0:00:42.910,0:00:44.230
each one one

0:00:44.230,0:00:48.380
tab press picture we could see that it's
compressed selby unzipped

0:00:48.380,0:00:51.520
to speech one one comp

0:00:51.520,0:00:53.510
presenter

0:00:53.510,0:00:57.950
now if we do in palestine shelved we
feel we've got an uncompressed file

0:00:57.950,0:01:03.020
gold go ahead and type file again on
each one one tablets

0:01:03.020,0:01:06.049
we see that it's each tier five data

0:01:06.049,0:01:11.130
so we can install the issue five tools
on you're going to since sudo

0:01:11.130,0:01:12.170
captain

0:01:12.170,0:01:17.010
hingis tall speech do you have five dash
tools

0:01:17.010,0:01:22.190
now i've believe area that installed

0:01:22.190,0:01:25.150
so it should tell me that nothing to do

0:01:25.150,0:01:26.720
not a problem

0:01:26.720,0:01:31.860
uh... if you've already got installed
doesn't hurt to re-install the software

0:01:31.860,0:01:37.680
source for dot by using a command called
each five ls will demand each five help

0:01:37.680,0:01:39.180
us

0:01:39.180,0:01:41.920
ends it generalist in command

0:01:41.920,0:01:42.670
that pretty

0:01:42.670,0:01:46.650
prints out some basic information about
any steer five final

0:01:46.650,0:01:47.780
so q

0:01:47.780,0:01:53.000
age five and a lot of speech one one
press tab animals to began

0:01:53.000,0:01:54.670
for breast cancer

0:01:54.670,0:01:58.280
it tells us that we've got something
called bag roots and something called

0:01:58.280,0:02:00.140
group

0:02:00.140,0:02:02.800
now we can do a little bit more we can
say each

0:02:02.800,0:02:05.640
five l ast dash dash re

0:02:05.640,0:02:07.079
cursive

0:02:07.079,0:02:10.979
so therefore we do that will give me an
aged five ls

0:02:10.979,0:02:12.809
to uh... swatch

0:02:12.809,0:02:14.309
for search

0:02:14.309,0:02:16.859
and type re

0:02:16.859,0:02:18.709
cursive

0:02:18.709,0:02:19.890
answer here this

0:02:19.890,0:02:25.220
group cousins down into the various
lists and i will show us down the tree a

0:02:25.220,0:02:26.189
little bit more

0:02:26.189,0:02:30.439
software internet will do each five ls
dash dash re

0:02:30.439,0:02:31.879
cursive

0:02:31.879,0:02:33.839
each one one param

0:02:33.839,0:02:37.439
and more workers to the list into our
bags so we have now

0:02:37.439,0:02:41.589
these results right here we can see that
you're a bag route we haven't

0:02:41.589,0:02:43.169
elevation

0:02:43.169,0:02:47.009
meditative something called tracking
list

0:02:47.009,0:02:48.699
and uncertainty

0:02:48.699,0:02:52.899
so this gives us our basic view of the
bag now it's best to usually start off

0:02:52.899,0:02:57.760
with the medicaid file to understand
what you're going to be getting into

0:02:57.760,0:02:58.749
and so

0:02:58.749,0:03:02.669
wikinews h five ls to actually take a
look at that matter davis will say

0:03:02.669,0:03:04.659
eighty-five ls

0:03:04.659,0:03:09.199
ham and will say dash dash simple

0:03:09.199,0:03:15.239
men dash d memory and give it a path to
you what we want to get

0:03:15.239,0:03:18.449
so used to have to complete the final
instances for for the farm and allstate

0:03:18.449,0:03:20.629
bag underscore

0:03:20.629,0:03:27.359
rupesh now each five ls treated very
much like a files inside of the bank

0:03:27.359,0:03:30.999
so them also a matter of data

0:03:30.999,0:03:31.849
deliberate manner

0:03:31.849,0:03:34.009
that they definitely don't

0:03:34.009,0:03:37.159
c_n_n_ pipettes ahead because there
might be a lot of stuff for a tutorial

0:03:37.159,0:03:41.039
expected to last to be safe the first
time through

0:03:41.039,0:03:45.489
and unfortunately it looks like we have
kind of a cookie format

0:03:45.489,0:03:46.780
so it's going to

0:03:46.780,0:03:48.979
one character per

0:03:48.979,0:03:50.069
line

0:03:50.069,0:03:56.819
to do that q and still ahead in say

0:03:56.819,0:03:59.639
okay that looks like we've got some
trouble here and we're going to work

0:03:59.639,0:04:04.209
with the spent fuel we continue to turn
into something better

0:04:04.209,0:04:08.400
so we can do a star building up using
various commands that we know with the

0:04:08.400,0:04:10.799
unix shell to try and he's got back
together

0:04:10.799,0:04:13.489
so we can see each five ls

0:04:13.489,0:04:15.659
dash dash simple

0:04:15.659,0:04:18.120
and now we can say dash d again

0:04:18.120,0:04:21.409
action cochran respect him before i go
crazy

0:04:21.409,0:04:24.430
so let's do the first thing that i can
think of which is

0:04:24.430,0:04:29.319
this is inherited a that doesn't go with
our contents of that

0:04:29.319,0:04:32.949
and we want to find call the strings
don't contain that's all we can do is we

0:04:32.949,0:04:34.080
can use

0:04:34.080,0:04:36.880
the quote that's in our other ones we
can say

0:04:36.880,0:04:38.879
there is a warning that i want to have

0:04:38.879,0:04:42.180
quotes so you can see he crept

0:04:42.180,0:04:43.810
and then single quotes

0:04:43.810,0:04:46.830
then double quotes what we're searching
for

0:04:46.830,0:04:51.949
commencing the quote salon a protected
that quota wise the shelving testing in

0:04:51.949,0:04:53.580
a string

0:04:53.580,0:04:55.819
and become a pipette to head

0:04:55.819,0:04:57.340
and if you notice here

0:04:57.340,0:05:00.930
the previous command we had the meta
data and data header

0:05:00.930,0:05:05.919
and this time temporary into the
contents of files

0:05:05.919,0:05:08.509
so its better we saw the ways to go

0:05:08.509,0:05:12.110
so we'll see if we can improve fatten
the next thing i would like to do

0:05:12.110,0:05:14.400
is let's see if we can

0:05:14.400,0:05:17.779
split these geese flying apart using the

0:05:17.779,0:05:20.629
quotes as our separator

0:05:20.629,0:05:24.259
using a trick that we've used before
with the company and we in the past week

0:05:24.259,0:05:26.529
up things apart based on

0:05:26.529,0:05:31.759
jobs or commerce let's cut with the
separator being the quote

0:05:31.759,0:05:32.970
doubleclick

0:05:32.970,0:05:36.400
so we can say is

0:05:36.400,0:05:39.299
connecticut eight dash d for delimiter

0:05:39.299,0:05:41.360
pandemic unspecified

0:05:41.360,0:05:45.930
if he's a backslash to tell the shell we
don't want to sort of strength

0:05:45.930,0:05:47.849
so that will give it the double quotes

0:05:47.849,0:05:52.539
and i will say dash afternoon to pick
the field says is going to be field one

0:05:52.539,0:05:56.189
has to be field key which we do want to
come in the city field three so we'll

0:05:56.189,0:05:58.209
actually get it to you

0:05:58.209,0:06:01.090
so taipei consumed to get

0:06:01.090,0:06:04.520
so there instead of having the quotes we
get everything on the line we're getting

0:06:04.520,0:06:06.599
better

0:06:06.599,0:06:10.989
family thing is is that we want to build
as it is a strain instead of one

0:06:10.989,0:06:12.789
character per line

0:06:12.789,0:06:15.549
sold say

0:06:15.549,0:06:18.500
please to translate commands thirty or

0:06:18.500,0:06:23.300
now i know that uh... dash d says it'll
lead to the character that we match and

0:06:23.300,0:06:25.019
real estate slash pen

0:06:25.019,0:06:28.159
which is the show way of saying newline

0:06:28.159,0:06:31.099
this is common for many programming
languages

0:06:31.099,0:06:35.459
so that's a new line in there to retake
those entrance we call the new lines

0:06:35.459,0:06:38.289
now produced ahead wouldn't make a lot
of sense

0:06:38.289,0:06:42.820
sort of have to us because they're just
going to be one big long line

0:06:42.820,0:06:47.759
so here it is this is singularly looking
meditative not very friendly but he

0:06:47.759,0:06:49.380
thinks it's a start

0:06:49.380,0:06:53.020
and you can appear here and see various
stuff you can see

0:06:53.020,0:06:56.779
alaska's announcement yesterday from
alaska

0:06:56.779,0:06:58.630
and we have

0:06:58.630,0:07:02.090
hydrographic hiding in there so there's
some words in here that f_ lee mean some

0:07:02.090,0:07:02.950
stuff

0:07:02.950,0:07:07.439
and let's go ahead and put out of this
will save it to a file

0:07:07.439,0:07:11.689
so instead of the las plate at the end
we're gonna say redirect with the

0:07:11.689,0:07:15.620
creative symbols maitri delete that
vertical bar for the paper

0:07:15.620,0:07:19.939
animals redirected to file so each one
the first time

0:07:19.939,0:07:23.020
delete that dot that they were in place
that with dashed

0:07:23.020,0:07:25.419
crying mornin

0:07:25.419,0:07:27.669
taxonomic

0:07:27.669,0:07:29.979
so now we see between external file

0:07:29.979,0:07:33.839
and would like to open that up in imax
and we can start working with a pen i

0:07:33.839,0:07:38.089
show you a little bit about how to use
imax to turn into something more

0:07:38.089,0:07:40.620
readable

0:07:40.620,0:07:44.229
and going to go ahead and hate

0:07:44.229,0:07:47.270
and for imax

0:07:47.270,0:07:50.050
kit that stirred up

0:07:50.050,0:07:54.099
being that i know this is x amount and i
have explained western allen's this

0:07:54.099,0:07:55.899
point in the videos

0:07:55.899,0:07:58.329
let's go ahead and open firefox

0:07:58.329,0:08:00.509
annual web browser will do

0:08:00.509,0:08:04.300
and research upon x_ amount

0:08:04.300,0:08:08.349
ever take a quick peek at the external
wikipedia entry just to see what exit

0:08:08.349,0:08:10.240
miles about

0:08:10.240,0:08:14.009
and here you can see extensible markup
language is set of rules for incoming

0:08:14.009,0:08:15.219
documents

0:08:15.219,0:08:19.909
he tries to be somewhat human readable
and it's structured around tag blocks to

0:08:19.909,0:08:22.139
have angle brackets

0:08:22.139,0:08:26.189
and if you can read through all of that
and read about how things are defined

0:08:26.189,0:08:28.049
how to validate this

0:08:28.049,0:08:30.979
and go through all the details

0:08:30.979,0:08:35.939
and just for the begins external tends
to start with the tag it looks like this

0:08:35.939,0:08:38.770
by itself

0:08:38.770,0:08:40.100
jeans

0:08:40.100,0:08:43.460
there's lots of information about all
the special including and one pot

0:08:43.460,0:08:45.880
college agreed that if you are
interested

0:08:45.880,0:08:49.840
otherwise we're going to basically three
external has alarmed by senior examples

0:08:49.840,0:08:51.460
kind of thing

0:08:51.460,0:08:53.530
let's get rid of that

0:08:53.530,0:08:55.180
and let's go with it

0:08:55.180,0:08:58.590
to our show and we can now open the
serpentine acts we can't say that you

0:08:58.590,0:09:03.870
max clients remember this is a commands
to tell you not to go ahead and file

0:09:03.870,0:09:05.280
dash dash no

0:09:05.280,0:09:06.930
dash wait says

0:09:06.930,0:09:10.050
pages go-ahead open up our world

0:09:10.050,0:09:12.730
so now we can say each one more and

0:09:12.730,0:09:14.740
pressed to happen

0:09:14.740,0:09:19.540
because again i will give his options
dash and try through retail who had

0:09:19.540,0:09:21.060
cancer

0:09:21.060,0:09:24.640
nephew max has unload called and x_
amount

0:09:24.640,0:09:30.040
that is a major road focusing on
handling x_ amount

0:09:30.040,0:09:34.100
keeping their here is it says invalid
which is a bummer uh... means that

0:09:34.100,0:09:38.420
something very wrong with our external
but we can at least make it look better

0:09:38.420,0:09:42.180
after we do that will actually come up
with a way to reviewed the mac external

0:09:42.180,0:09:45.000
things correct

0:09:45.000,0:09:48.340
so if we see some of these times has a
little harder but if we do in here in

0:09:48.340,0:09:49.400
scene

0:09:49.400,0:09:52.239
there's these great of them less ten
pairs where

0:09:52.239,0:09:56.320
the end of one carrying secures the end
of position name

0:09:56.320,0:10:00.770
and the is the end of one tag and then
the beginning of the next tag and so

0:10:00.770,0:10:03.340
cannot resist this slash

0:10:03.340,0:10:06.270
to mark the end stag

0:10:06.270,0:10:08.449
so will cc on groups

0:10:08.449,0:10:11.190
and do you

0:10:11.190,0:10:14.520
uh... so we'll see that role starts here

0:10:14.520,0:10:19.060
and then roll and story here with that
extra slash partner

0:10:19.060,0:10:22.070
and what we can do is we can replace

0:10:22.070,0:10:26.499
those to you characters with something
that we want to have in place

0:10:26.499,0:10:28.780
so we can do an escape

0:10:28.780,0:10:32.640
less stamp which is in an adolescent
emptying the font

0:10:32.640,0:10:35.960
and we can try our first command any
messages

0:10:35.960,0:10:37.630
now that tax

0:10:37.630,0:10:39.740
and then we'll do query

0:10:39.740,0:10:41.459
dash commands happened

0:10:41.459,0:10:42.559
replaced

0:10:42.559,0:10:46.780
this is going to do a replacement ask us
each time

0:10:46.780,0:10:49.850
and amassing a press controlled sheet
here

0:10:49.850,0:10:51.740
animus put the buffer

0:10:51.740,0:10:54.430
in a minute whose trolex to you

0:10:54.430,0:10:57.680
and then i'm gonna open up a test file
so we'll just see task dot

0:10:57.680,0:10:59.590
ta the

0:10:59.590,0:11:02.830
and i'm not sure you a couple commands
that are very he needed will use in just

0:11:02.830,0:11:04.340
a second

0:11:04.340,0:11:06.970
enter give myself some space

0:11:06.970,0:11:10.350
if you want to try and put it online
character

0:11:10.350,0:11:13.820
inside of the command we have to be able
to more than presenter because when we

0:11:13.820,0:11:17.600
hit enter inside of the clear place
command it's gonna finish up the queer

0:11:17.600,0:11:19.110
place

0:11:19.110,0:11:20.450
so there's a special command

0:11:20.450,0:11:23.300
cold control q

0:11:23.300,0:11:26.249
nephew to control q the very next
carefree type

0:11:26.249,0:11:28.950
is gonna literally get stuck into the

0:11:28.950,0:11:32.770
terminal so if we hit say

0:11:32.770,0:11:36.150
then it's creating just a cheeky it's
not very exciting

0:11:36.150,0:11:37.850
if you want to do you say

0:11:37.850,0:11:42.260
control to u_s_ wanna put it out there
couldn't have been hit tab

0:11:42.260,0:11:43.270
and now when i

0:11:43.270,0:11:49.340
move left with one key we jump back and
forth over an actual time character

0:11:49.340,0:11:50.510
now if you want to put in

0:11:50.510,0:11:52.290
newline we can do

0:11:52.290,0:11:53.890
control to you

0:11:53.890,0:11:54.870
command

0:11:54.870,0:11:57.920
as a special key control j

0:11:57.920,0:12:02.030
and that puts in actual newline
character without actually

0:12:02.030,0:12:04.200
being equipment oppressing return

0:12:04.200,0:12:07.410
so if you ever need in line and you
don't want to be hitting the return ke

0:12:07.410,0:12:09.880
was sometimes has special meaning in
imax

0:12:09.880,0:12:12.650
can you control q control j

0:12:12.650,0:12:15.590
now if you just use controls a on its
own aids

0:12:15.590,0:12:16.750
going down

0:12:16.750,0:12:19.680
control key his previous

0:12:19.680,0:12:26.680
control and control jr the same thing
down the line control peas applied

0:12:26.830,0:12:29.320
so that's a nice way to be opened a new
line

0:12:29.320,0:12:33.050
and you can also use for north of other
characters iran interpreter dot

0:12:33.050,0:12:35.550
controller zero

0:12:35.550,0:12:39.570
an hour to replace though

0:12:39.570,0:12:43.430
grier then west fans with a great unless
end up with a new line in between

0:12:43.430,0:12:45.960
chemical wife look better

0:12:45.960,0:12:48.010

0:12:48.010,0:12:50.640
query dash tab

0:12:50.640,0:12:52.130

0:12:52.130,0:12:56.450
now are replaced grier then lets them
press answer

0:12:56.450,0:13:00.590
emmy for preset with greater than less
than people go back to the middle

0:13:00.590,0:13:02.160
positive control q

0:13:02.160,0:13:05.010
unanimity of controlled j

0:13:05.010,0:13:08.940
and that put anyone reading between the
two now i press the anterior or return

0:13:08.940,0:13:09.810
key

0:13:09.810,0:13:11.370
and that will run act

0:13:11.370,0:13:15.110
and now arena mode worth it passes on
each one of the highlights what's

0:13:15.110,0:13:18.010
highlighting apparatus team here

0:13:18.010,0:13:22.550
now for hit the space bar that's equal
point of yes so that's great i can't

0:13:22.550,0:13:26.630
keep doing that i can also press the
anki and skip a bunch

0:13:26.630,0:13:27.880
stays

0:13:27.880,0:13:30.970
now it's not really what we want to do
this is a big file

0:13:30.970,0:13:35.430
he'll be just wanna zoom through all of
them and give it a go

0:13:35.430,0:13:38.430
so what we can do is controlled shift

0:13:38.430,0:13:43.550
from the underscore wilted undo each of
those get back to where we were

0:13:43.550,0:13:47.529
so now you can see there's no stars down
here has been modified

0:13:47.529,0:13:49.700
old email lust and

0:13:49.700,0:13:52.650
power back at the beginning was to the
whole thing

0:13:52.650,0:13:55.830
and put before it to you that let me
tell you the

0:13:55.830,0:13:58.829
if you want your career placement not at
all

0:13:58.829,0:14:00.120
you can do

0:14:00.120,0:14:02.560

0:14:02.560,0:14:04.530

0:14:04.530,0:14:08.280
on the mac or escape

0:14:08.280,0:14:09.380
shift

0:14:09.380,0:14:10.570
option

0:14:10.570,0:14:14.040
percent or alter on a pc keyboard
typically

0:14:14.040,0:14:15.110
percent

0:14:15.110,0:14:18.870
and we put get queer replace if i were
to hit answer right here if we do the

0:14:18.870,0:14:20.740
same exact command

0:14:20.740,0:14:24.530
and you can also scroll back through
some of the things that you had in your

0:14:24.530,0:14:28.360
previous commands by using the
up-and-down arrow keys

0:14:28.360,0:14:33.990
controls you quit out of africa now it's
good you all of them cement acts

0:14:33.990,0:14:37.329
actually let me show you another way
that we could do this

0:14:37.329,0:14:42.630
if we control s to search for creative
must and will find the first one

0:14:42.630,0:14:45.350
let me go ahead and press answer

0:14:45.350,0:14:50.540
and so now we have been you technically
once a week and press control space

0:14:50.540,0:14:52.370
move forward highlight the region

0:14:52.370,0:14:57.420

it in the car

0:14:57.420,0:15:03.550
cut buffer oracle portal ramona collette
so the american x replace string

0:15:03.550,0:15:05.960
pressed hard when you're close enough

0:15:05.960,0:15:07.380
pressed enter

0:15:07.380,0:15:10.760
and they will actually remember the
opening and we could just type in grier

0:15:10.760,0:15:12.080
then left and

0:15:12.080,0:15:17.070
and now in my the po reckoned control

0:15:20.450,0:15:23.050
and now exit through the entire file

0:15:23.050,0:15:26.800
all hundred sixty-nine lines as you see
you're here

0:15:26.800,0:15:29.420
passed on the whole replacement

0:15:29.420,0:15:31.890
to know we have a file that

0:15:31.890,0:15:35.630
looks kinda like what we want we can do
you control status

0:15:35.630,0:15:38.160

0:15:38.160,0:15:40.410

0:15:49.260,0:15:50.800
breast cancer

0:15:50.800,0:15:54.650
came out pretty good enough to take this
wider a little bit to make it easier to

0:15:54.650,0:15:55.670
see

0:15:55.670,0:15:58.930
and we can now start seeing some of the
structure of x_ amount so here is a

0:15:58.930,0:16:00.180
blockade

0:16:00.180,0:16:05.820
and sided has deacon date type so
there's actually tags within tags

0:16:05.820,0:16:09.640
this is the basic structure and look at
that somehow all those files i messed up

0:16:09.640,0:16:14.640
we can see that it still says invalid
down here

0:16:14.640,0:16:19.000
and we have some very strange things
like presents here he's running around

0:16:19.000,0:16:24.000
films are through the skit characters
that we don't really want to deal with

0:16:24.000,0:16:29.840
so let's go back to our show me first
say this control x control s

0:16:29.840,0:16:33.399
aiming to overhear and we can also try
another command teach act

0:16:33.399,0:16:37.900

0:17:06.550,0:17:08.640
twenty right here

0:17:08.640,0:17:11.150
so clearly something is definitely not
great

0:17:11.150,0:17:14.230
but let's go ahead and do eight
different method to get a reaction now

0:17:14.230,0:17:19.320
which is going to be a lot more affected
and we want you to do the craziness imax

0:17:19.320,0:17:20.750
which was

0:17:20.750,0:17:24.910
really illustrated in terms of using the
meta exper place and replaced ringo

0:17:24.910,0:17:28.070
zipping soyuz all the time he max

0:17:28.070,0:17:31.220
but let's go ahead and get ourselves and
i still looking

0:17:31.220,0:17:35.000
matter datafile directly from different
commands

0:17:35.000,0:17:36.370
now i'm in it

0:17:36.370,0:17:39.950
should walk you through this and i'll
show you electric values echo to test

0:17:39.950,0:17:43.670
out commands very often just to see
what's going on with the show

0:17:43.670,0:17:48.070
so each five dumped now this is just
going to print out to the screen was

0:17:48.070,0:17:49.789
going to do

0:17:49.789,0:17:53.380
and before i do that and at that time
there

0:17:53.380,0:17:54.730
yourselves a comment

0:17:54.730,0:17:55.660

0:17:55.660,0:17:57.050

0:18:03.270,0:18:07.030
it's a little weird there's an age five
and a lesson each five dump

0:18:07.030,0:18:11.050
and that you can do some more things
with both page five don't actually has a

0:18:11.050,0:18:14.160
different options that will help us out
in this case

0:18:14.160,0:18:18.640
so leave it to you to read through that
manual page at your leisure

0:18:18.640,0:18:21.840
if you're feeling like you can't sleep
that's a great resource

0:18:21.840,0:18:23.330
so you can type

0:18:23.330,0:18:24.630
echo

0:18:24.630,0:18:27.260
h five dumped

0:18:27.260,0:18:28.330
states

0:18:28.330,0:18:30.370
now we're gonna use two dash bs

0:18:30.370,0:18:33.830
final option which is going to write it
out to afire

0:18:33.830,0:18:36.980
for whichever section we're gonna grab

0:18:36.980,0:18:37.780
painted

0:18:37.780,0:18:42.420
we can then do u dash quot for where
it's going to write the output to h one

0:18:42.420,0:18:44.660
more and prince param

0:18:44.660,0:18:47.280
and now we want

0:18:47.280,0:18:49.130
x unknown rather than

0:18:49.130,0:18:52.350
meeting also we can avenue filed before

0:18:52.350,0:18:54.850
try one in place

0:18:54.850,0:18:59.550
and then with the final opportunity
readings for each one one

0:18:59.550,0:19:00.350
that

0:19:00.350,0:19:07.350
and let's see what happens

0:19:07.700,0:19:10.309
plus the commander in the beginning

0:19:10.309,0:19:12.260
games

0:19:12.260,0:19:15.190
i'm a quick look at something really
quick so

0:19:15.190,0:19:22.190
piece of music if you've got it

0:19:23.360,0:19:26.530
i'm looking up each five dot to make
sure i've got the right to me and my

0:19:26.530,0:19:27.840
other notes

0:19:27.840,0:19:32.090
and i clearly tell so i actually need to
add something real quick to what we just

0:19:32.090,0:19:36.510
did

0:19:36.510,0:19:39.840
and let's go ahead and do it so i can
tell he tried some which part of the

0:19:39.840,0:19:42.820
filing adopts those kind of important

0:19:42.820,0:19:46.600
so we can put that hope recovery about
here

0:19:46.600,0:19:48.350
so i will say

0:19:48.350,0:19:49.450
uh...

0:19:49.450,0:19:51.360
dash d

0:19:51.360,0:19:52.830

0:19:52.830,0:19:54.820

0:20:01.310,0:20:05.560
projects dot great amanda data space

0:20:05.560,0:20:09.320
so that's the basic command that we want
to have run into right here

0:20:09.320,0:20:12.600
sliver echo is just printing to the
screen

0:20:12.600,0:20:16.510
and i'm sure you any little trick that i
use a lot more no i don't want to take

0:20:16.510,0:20:18.080
as much

0:20:18.080,0:20:20.090
character strings on my own

0:20:20.090,0:20:23.240
smith the apparel seen them in two weeks

0:20:23.240,0:20:25.570
everything back to this x_ amount

0:20:25.570,0:20:29.370
and i'm not in use that curly braces and
shall

0:20:29.370,0:20:32.620
and then man at a common bag

0:20:32.620,0:20:37.700
and encourage recently to a little bit
wonders concedes on one line

0:20:37.700,0:20:39.710
into the section right here

0:20:39.710,0:20:42.570
with the curly braces this is a
replacement

0:20:42.570,0:20:45.220
so it's going to take this text

0:20:45.220,0:20:46.700
to the period

0:20:46.700,0:20:50.400
an appendix in on it and then the next
argument isn't take this text again

0:20:50.400,0:20:53.310
independent bag on a sizzle

0:20:53.310,0:20:56.620
for cat for specifying lots of different
things quickly

0:20:56.620,0:20:57.919
presenter

0:20:57.919,0:21:01.029
and so now we have a nice command that
hopefully

0:21:01.029,0:21:03.309
should work

0:21:03.309,0:21:06.870
semicolon removed that echo

0:21:06.870,0:21:07.750
and

0:21:07.750,0:21:11.630
now you can see right here that it's
going off and on something this told us

0:21:11.630,0:21:13.380
a little bit more about

0:21:13.380,0:21:15.300
there's no data fields

0:21:15.300,0:21:20.540
and if you look great hindered it typed
consistent each five team string and

0:21:20.540,0:21:25.030
strength lies isn't one so what they've
done in the mcc the bag midday to

0:21:25.030,0:21:25.980
standard

0:21:25.980,0:21:27.679
was actually say that

0:21:27.679,0:21:31.800
it's composed of a lot of strings of
going to go in character and that's why

0:21:31.800,0:21:33.610
we have still weird format

0:21:33.610,0:21:36.770
but now if we do and i watched that show

0:21:36.770,0:21:42.370
we can see that we've got our bag final
from before are

0:21:42.370,0:21:44.960
maybe that we tried to bring out the
first time

0:21:44.960,0:21:47.040
commensurate with imax

0:21:47.040,0:21:52.230
and it till the backup file from imax
that's when he saved the file

0:21:52.230,0:21:56.110
and then here's our new midday to follow
or work within seconds

0:21:56.110,0:22:00.710
and then we've got a strange thing he
recalls password pounding on it that's

0:22:00.710,0:22:02.840
imax is auto save

0:22:02.840,0:22:05.010
falcon mentioned so we'll go ahead and

0:22:05.010,0:22:06.700
and do less

0:22:06.700,0:22:12.799
of each one more and pressed hard dot x
announces a new one that should be ok

0:22:12.799,0:22:15.860
it'll look here this actually looks a
lot better than us

0:22:15.860,0:22:18.240
the question mark that we were expecting

0:22:18.240,0:22:21.340
thereafter weird percent characters

0:22:21.340,0:22:25.399
and things look a little bit better it's
still kinda hard to read without

0:22:25.399,0:22:29.260
all those new lines that we would like
to see if it's better

0:22:29.260,0:22:33.040
now let's go ahead and hip to you get
out of what's and let's take a quick

0:22:33.040,0:22:34.779
peak and see if we can

0:22:34.779,0:22:36.350
validate this

0:22:36.350,0:22:39.159
so exim owl lends

0:22:39.159,0:22:41.460
each woman pressed iron

0:22:41.460,0:22:46.220
and and uh... maximo we'll see what
happens

0:22:46.220,0:22:48.820
all right so it just dump the entire
thing on earth

0:22:48.820,0:22:52.010
and back up and see if we can find the
beginning

0:22:52.010,0:22:57.400
so the behavior of externalities if it
sees a successful parsed file no here is

0:22:57.400,0:22:58.650
a confined

0:22:58.650,0:23:01.890
yeah she's fifteen tire file back at you

0:23:01.890,0:23:04.430
so and i feel like this far number again

0:23:04.430,0:23:08.510
so let's go ahead and say imax clients

0:23:08.510,0:23:11.200
dash dash no dash weight

0:23:11.200,0:23:14.370
and then we'll see heat when more
impressed i am

0:23:14.370,0:23:16.049
period syndrome

0:23:16.049,0:23:20.280
sonoran airtel imax open up that file
press entered

0:23:20.280,0:23:21.620
if you look down here

0:23:21.620,0:23:26.500
an external modem actually thinks the
files ballot this is much better

0:23:26.500,0:23:27.710
and say now

0:23:27.710,0:23:32.159
things are looking a little bit more
consistently can-do minute acts

0:23:32.159,0:23:37.110
replace strong rain

0:23:37.110,0:23:38.720
tab answer

0:23:38.720,0:23:42.659
and we can just use that last one that
we had before by putting in the new

0:23:42.659,0:23:45.010
lines prasanna

0:23:45.010,0:23:46.380
through the bottom

0:23:46.380,0:23:50.690
control space meadow ask them to jump to
the beginning

0:23:50.690,0:23:53.860
and now it's the same enacts indent

0:23:53.860,0:23:55.019
region

0:23:55.019,0:23:57.490
came with that will happen and into the
finals

0:23:57.490,0:23:59.220
press answer

0:23:59.220,0:24:04.000
control x control us to save it it still
says about over here soon lines are

0:24:04.000,0:24:07.480
allowed in the xml format so it doesn't
really care too much about

0:24:07.480,0:24:10.100
the space in between your tags

0:24:10.100,0:24:13.530
and now we have a much more readable
file mississippi through what's going on

0:24:13.530,0:24:17.770
here than you can see some of the quirks
of how people recommended a day

0:24:17.770,0:24:21.540
that uh... versions of paris right out
the path to the file which isn't that's

0:24:21.540,0:24:24.559
a very helpful to us as anon

0:24:24.559,0:24:29.970
user of terrace in this case i was just
a consumer data coming out of parents

0:24:29.970,0:24:33.340
so hopefully they'll fix the titles of
bags sometime in your future you can

0:24:33.340,0:24:36.839
start looking at that gate at bundy
abstractly about

0:24:36.839,0:24:38.029
notes on the data

0:24:38.029,0:24:41.479
answer picking through the downing marks
another useful stuff but i do you need

0:24:41.479,0:24:43.400
mild-mannered

0:24:43.400,0:24:44.850
so that's it for this time

0:24:44.850,0:24:47.280
