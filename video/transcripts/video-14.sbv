0:00:01.770,0:00:05.880
a little of my name is correct where
annis is a research tools video fourteen

0:00:05.880,0:00:07.490
papon part seven

0:00:07.490,0:00:09.229
more reusable code

0:00:09.229,0:00:13.209
this is a part of the u_n_h_c_r_
proposed solution mapping during high

0:00:13.209,0:00:14.509
traffic center

0:00:14.509,0:00:16.609
research tools course

0:00:16.609,0:00:20.919
and in this video we're gonna go through
some of the coded that we had from

0:00:20.919,0:00:23.679
before so in video thirteen

0:00:23.679,0:00:25.650
we took i'll look at

0:00:25.650,0:00:28.140
a parting nema strings

0:00:28.140,0:00:31.480
out sickly veggie g_a_ g_p_s_ message

0:00:31.480,0:00:34.000
we're a little purser your

0:00:34.000,0:00:39.490
that walks through it and pulls out the
latching on student reaction the wire

0:00:39.490,0:00:43.670
and returned analysts of coordinates for
that

0:00:43.670,0:00:47.530
but the key thing here is that this was
just in the first pass through writing a

0:00:47.530,0:00:50.050
paper function to participate in

0:00:50.050,0:00:51.840
and we'd like to start building

0:00:51.840,0:00:54.910
software that week in review throughout
their projects

0:00:54.910,0:00:57.880
and i'm by taking a little bit more
about how we might wanna lay out the

0:00:57.880,0:00:58.740
data

0:00:58.740,0:01:00.040
and uh...

0:01:00.040,0:01:04.230
and more functions impartially
prototypes administering the cutter

0:01:04.230,0:01:07.720
so we're gonna go ahead and start with a
new trial and we're going to work

0:01:07.720,0:01:09.310
through building

0:01:09.310,0:01:12.460
purser for number of any messages

0:01:12.460,0:01:16.260
and first let's get some idea

0:01:16.260,0:01:20.030
so how many years ago you guessed a poll
this file neema

0:01:20.030,0:01:22.330
log-on easy too

0:01:22.330,0:01:25.630
and in his file it's a little bit
different moscow i'd remove the action

0:01:25.630,0:01:29.670
editor that my mother puts unfair so
we'd just have traditional negated

0:01:29.670,0:01:30.549
without

0:01:30.549,0:01:33.830
reaction and a half an hour from having
my files

0:01:33.830,0:01:35.960
going at the data

0:01:35.960,0:01:41.000
and will do a unless i shall see how
we're doing here will be and sent to you

0:01:41.000,0:01:43.530
that faro

0:01:43.530,0:01:44.950
now i'm compress it

0:01:44.950,0:01:49.570
we'll take a quick peekskill wordcount
dash alle movement dot log

0:01:49.570,0:01:51.730
who've got quite a few lines

0:01:51.730,0:01:54.690
and will do my head and uh... uh... blog

0:01:54.690,0:01:58.710
so there are some that data and
traditionally this institute some right

0:01:58.710,0:02:00.329
here right after that

0:02:00.329,0:02:04.990
would be message that uh... which
receiving station and the time it was

0:02:04.990,0:02:05.939
recorded

0:02:05.939,0:02:09.360
this is what you actually get over a
serial port without any more anxious dot

0:02:09.360,0:02:11.009
on

0:02:11.009,0:02:14.679
so let's go create ourselves file that's
a little bit more reasonable school

0:02:14.679,0:02:18.439
college nema da party and soviet
basically a module

0:02:18.439,0:02:21.349
cancer talked with some documentation

0:02:21.349,0:02:24.499
and most say na

0:02:24.499,0:02:27.709
popeye

0:02:27.709,0:02:28.480
niemeyer

0:02:28.480,0:02:30.889
ascii

0:02:30.889,0:02:32.749
messages

0:02:32.749,0:02:36.169
from g_p_s_ and either

0:02:36.169,0:02:38.149
replacements

0:02:38.149,0:02:41.779
so typically we have a real hollywood
actually have

0:02:41.779,0:02:45.789
something a little more clients were not
without concern

0:02:45.789,0:02:48.569
ends

0:02:48.569,0:02:52.589
let's go ahead and fire off my pipeline

0:02:52.589,0:02:56.549
two you have a place to work with

0:02:56.549,0:03:00.620
in political round one of the d_e_a_'s
turns them into an amit

0:03:00.620,0:03:01.989
copied

0:03:01.989,0:03:03.610
and will start off with

0:03:03.610,0:03:06.549
test g_e_ equals

0:03:06.549,0:03:10.549
and we'll just give ourselves and at
work with wording

0:03:10.549,0:03:12.179
controlled wine

0:03:12.179,0:03:14.469
and never tested to work with

0:03:14.469,0:03:19.599
so we can with this very boring module
we can sit in court month

0:03:19.599,0:03:21.620
an unknown dot

0:03:21.620,0:03:22.430
and

0:03:22.430,0:03:26.019
see what's possible we can also say here

0:03:26.019,0:03:28.769
nina and i will give us to be

0:03:28.769,0:03:29.659
hooked up

0:03:29.659,0:03:31.749
fingers by that module

0:03:31.749,0:03:36.359
now distances are catching in a string
so we can save twenty

0:03:36.359,0:03:39.209
night dot test

0:03:39.209,0:03:40.579
gta

0:03:40.579,0:03:44.339
and we've got one line agreement to work
with

0:03:44.339,0:03:46.450
before we hand was

0:03:46.450,0:03:49.800
he was put control x two control acts

0:03:49.800,0:03:51.180
and then i'd be

0:03:51.180,0:03:54.339
and we'll switch back to our all file

0:03:54.339,0:03:58.419
we went through an entire file and we
only partially g_-eight

0:03:58.419,0:04:00.719
it might be better to have function

0:04:00.719,0:04:01.700
because i was just

0:04:01.700,0:04:03.590
a low energy dac

0:04:03.590,0:04:04.189
and

0:04:04.189,0:04:07.569
rather than a returning a long list of
strings

0:04:07.569,0:04:10.259
or about coordinates we want something
that

0:04:10.259,0:04:14.610
blessed and figure out which parts of an
industry where gramm wanna mess with

0:04:14.610,0:04:17.849
and to the way you know what you got hit
with a dictionary

0:04:17.849,0:04:20.109
so who need it

0:04:20.109,0:04:23.759
equals and i want something more like
those acts

0:04:23.759,0:04:25.629
and then we could say

0:04:25.629,0:04:30.130
miners seven going

0:04:30.130,0:04:32.050
line

0:04:32.050,0:04:33.719
animals anywhere

0:04:33.719,0:04:35.259
portent

0:04:35.259,0:04:37.119
eight

0:04:37.119,0:04:38.460
okay enter

0:04:38.460,0:04:41.379
amplitype p_m_

0:04:41.379,0:04:44.219
get back exactly same thing that it's a

0:04:44.219,0:04:45.460
sub acts

0:04:45.460,0:04:48.409
as kind of like accessing an array of it
by

0:04:48.409,0:04:49.939
i mean field

0:04:49.939,0:04:53.809
and that would then be able to pull out
are action wise so let's wait

0:04:53.809,0:04:57.300
we can become albany creek you've
mentioned conspiracy

0:04:57.300,0:04:58.740
at a time in here

0:04:58.740,0:04:59.569
there's

0:04:59.569,0:05:03.199
latitude their quantity and letters

0:05:03.199,0:05:07.139
heels over here it would like to your
question my which means uh... altitude

0:05:07.139,0:05:11.369
that you've just received reports the
check this one

0:05:11.369,0:05:14.449
let's go ahead and start building
yourself up archer

0:05:14.449,0:05:17.520
it's going to work on just one malign
and then you can read combined that

0:05:17.520,0:05:21.650
together with other stuff to walk
through a file for principia gravel

0:05:21.650,0:05:23.189
parts

0:05:23.189,0:05:25.630
so control x zero zero credit dot

0:05:25.630,0:05:26.749
window

0:05:26.749,0:05:30.380
counseling curse of the function called
gta

0:05:30.380,0:05:34.880
and can take a call line

0:05:34.880,0:05:38.449
right now let's do nothing to member of
the past command just does nothing it's

0:05:38.449,0:05:41.360
a placeholder continue uh... reloading

0:05:41.360,0:05:43.229
month

0:05:43.229,0:05:47.889
and what we're going to be giving us a
calling night dot g_g_ paying

0:05:47.889,0:05:50.370
and passed it word dot

0:05:50.370,0:05:51.769
yay

0:05:51.769,0:05:54.279
right now it is absolutely nothing

0:05:54.279,0:05:59.629
but that gives us the basics uh...
function and that was in a bit washout

0:05:59.629,0:06:03.979
that typically how r ten mr tripping is
the first thing i would do

0:06:03.979,0:06:07.759
plans and test to make sure that were
actually looking at the right to death

0:06:07.759,0:06:11.659
so we know that there's going to be g_g_
inside of

0:06:11.659,0:06:15.389
that wind and if there's not going to
problems along overturned alternative

0:06:15.389,0:06:16.989
task that's okay

0:06:16.989,0:06:19.639
launched

0:06:19.639,0:06:20.889
uh...

0:06:20.889,0:06:22.120
wealthiest

0:06:22.120,0:06:23.410
g_g_ a

0:06:23.410,0:06:25.199
marked

0:06:25.199,0:06:28.740
in

0:06:28.740,0:06:30.589
what's his right over here

0:06:30.589,0:06:33.690
in

0:06:33.690,0:06:37.889
personally straightened out soon yun

0:06:37.889,0:06:39.459
and

0:06:39.459,0:06:40.609
one

0:06:40.609,0:06:41.430
cast

0:06:41.430,0:06:42.339
eugene

0:06:42.339,0:06:43.389
true

0:06:43.389,0:06:45.710
and earlier ones with the d_a_

0:06:45.710,0:06:48.229
to that's false that's good

0:06:48.229,0:06:50.139
so let's try and not

0:06:50.139,0:06:54.729
so that will be true than if we try

0:06:54.729,0:06:56.110
in gta

0:06:56.110,0:06:57.530
that's falls so

0:06:57.530,0:06:59.690
what we wanted something like this so
that if

0:06:59.690,0:07:03.659
weekend i want it doesn't have a gta
that returns true on them again

0:07:03.659,0:07:06.410
that had sent eugene not and

0:07:06.410,0:07:08.069
wine

0:07:08.069,0:07:11.379
and they can say return

0:07:11.379,0:07:16.900
now i understand that we are waiting for
parenting hate workout one

0:07:16.900,0:07:20.270
you could also throw exceptions we
haven't gotten popular exception yet but

0:07:20.270,0:07:21.819
we can

0:07:21.819,0:07:23.490
raising python

0:07:23.490,0:07:25.919
uh... pro and con languages

0:07:25.919,0:07:28.929
so that's our quick check for sending

0:07:28.929,0:07:30.599
and then we can say

0:07:30.599,0:07:33.569
repairable level results dictionary

0:07:33.569,0:07:37.749
and this is an anti dictionary which
include races

0:07:37.749,0:07:39.860
animal return

0:07:39.860,0:07:41.269
results

0:07:41.269,0:07:45.009
that will hopefully have actual
southwest on mental state would control

0:07:45.009,0:07:47.819
acts well lasts

0:07:47.819,0:07:51.080
and let's go ahead and try that with
uh... remote school do control our

0:07:51.080,0:07:53.339
church backwards

0:07:53.339,0:07:57.000
minimal typable carton and then press
enter

0:07:57.000,0:07:59.370
bullets go up to our functionally
hamburg

0:07:59.370,0:08:01.719
for this is our guest function

0:08:01.719,0:08:05.599
and we get back are anki dictionary
there

0:08:05.599,0:08:09.640
that's looking pretty gaiden we now have
our scaffold opens

0:08:09.640,0:08:11.439
and will start person

0:08:11.439,0:08:15.269
and building our our results

0:08:15.269,0:08:16.120
the first part

0:08:16.120,0:08:22.020
a large ups during is g_p_ that's our
parker so this is the device that sent

0:08:22.020,0:08:25.129
out the message in this case gps jesper
g_p_s_

0:08:25.129,0:08:28.520
who can say results

0:08:28.520,0:08:30.279
talker

0:08:30.279,0:08:34.940
equals and memory card lines in line

0:08:34.940,0:08:38.620
and glad to see where the sins so let's
go ahead and jump on it over to the

0:08:38.620,0:08:40.669
polls saying na

0:08:40.669,0:08:41.570
test

0:08:41.570,0:08:43.110
g_g_

0:08:43.110,0:08:46.610
mentally published ur one

0:08:46.610,0:08:47.810
used

0:08:47.810,0:08:53.310
let's see if it's a great and in fact
the energy p back upstream

0:08:53.310,0:08:56.200
will go ahead and line

0:08:56.200,0:08:58.140
one bring

0:08:58.140,0:09:00.450
can actually get a fair talker

0:09:00.450,0:09:03.660
bruce protest at the job so we say that

0:09:03.660,0:09:06.190
and will come to a new reload

0:09:06.190,0:09:08.240
and we'll try it out

0:09:08.240,0:09:13.390
so now we have are tucker captured into
our return dictionary

0:09:13.390,0:09:16.150
let's go ahead and keep going

0:09:16.150,0:09:17.840
now you could

0:09:17.840,0:09:19.650
i got the message from

0:09:19.650,0:09:23.010
withholds

0:09:23.010,0:09:25.280
uh... using matters hyatt

0:09:25.280,0:09:26.519
or something like that

0:09:26.519,0:09:30.079
we could pick up or not we know it is
going to be a huge new weren't estimates

0:09:30.079,0:09:33.880
of g_g_

0:09:33.880,0:09:37.810
now will go start working on the various
parts of the first thing we're gonna get

0:09:37.810,0:09:38.930
is org

0:09:38.930,0:09:42.300
time within hours minutes seconds flat
terrain here

0:09:42.300,0:09:46.380
protest actions is kind of one points
and zero zero zero

0:09:46.380,0:09:48.990
so perhaps we want to get better test
message

0:09:48.990,0:09:52.570
so let's go ahead and tight

0:09:52.570,0:09:57.490
what's system solo bang is the show
command sold to bang

0:09:57.490,0:09:59.270
head dash

0:09:59.270,0:10:03.370
and thousands of where i think the first
ten thousand lines

0:10:03.370,0:10:04.660
jeans

0:10:04.660,0:10:07.100
we're gonna collapse or

0:10:07.100,0:10:08.280
gta

0:10:08.280,0:10:12.020
this organism including one picture
seriously a whole bunch of stuff was

0:10:12.020,0:10:13.920
gone

0:10:13.920,0:10:16.100
exactly accurate violent

0:10:16.100,0:10:18.500
so ne

0:10:18.500,0:10:21.220
uh... want

0:10:21.220,0:10:24.250
winter clothing have their complete

0:10:24.250,0:10:29.520
so here's a whole bunch of things and
this is a much better test virtual

0:10:29.520,0:10:32.130
just go around

0:10:32.130,0:10:33.800
this long

0:10:33.800,0:10:35.170
right there

0:10:35.170,0:10:37.450
g

0:10:37.450,0:10:38.800
gains

0:10:38.800,0:10:43.300
we're going to go and common out that
moment with our own kamal saying testing

0:10:43.300,0:10:45.290
g_g_ equals

0:10:45.290,0:10:47.310
and complete in

0:10:47.310,0:10:48.900
martin text-align

0:10:48.900,0:10:52.120
so that's why i want to give us a little
more interesting in terms of time that

0:10:52.120,0:10:54.950
we can make sure that we're getting the
right fields

0:10:54.950,0:10:57.550
sources results

0:10:57.550,0:10:58.700
and

0:10:58.700,0:11:03.360
i grew up here we actually want to start
thinking about splitting apart

0:11:03.360,0:11:06.300
our message though i mean it's a

0:11:06.300,0:11:08.069
fields equals

0:11:08.069,0:11:12.270
weingarten splits

0:11:12.270,0:11:16.540
emphasises comma-separated values taipei
deference form a common sense is going

0:11:16.540,0:11:18.030
to give us

0:11:18.030,0:11:20.290
the time he was just one of them

0:11:20.290,0:11:21.899
and we can say results

0:11:21.899,0:11:23.720
our

0:11:23.720,0:11:29.020
equals fields sound and then moving
things this field zero nemesis killed

0:11:29.020,0:11:30.320
one

0:11:30.320,0:11:31.230
subfields

0:11:31.230,0:11:34.980
one paragraph of the first two
characters are back

0:11:34.980,0:11:36.910
so we'll see

0:11:36.910,0:11:40.500
quarantine show from the beginning with
nothing in there and then call on

0:11:40.500,0:11:43.400

0:11:53.880,0:11:56.850
forward not not including for

0:11:56.850,0:12:00.390

0:12:00.390,0:12:01.700
snoops

0:12:01.700,0:12:03.660
second

0:12:03.660,0:12:04.429
equals

0:12:04.429,0:12:07.630
fields

0:12:07.630,0:12:08.850
portrayed

0:12:08.850,0:12:10.110
distributing

0:12:10.110,0:12:13.540
so let's go ahead and try this and see
if we haven't voted yet or how we're

0:12:13.540,0:12:14.690
doing

0:12:14.690,0:12:17.650
political remove

0:12:17.650,0:12:21.650

0:12:23.930,0:12:25.000
decanter

0:12:25.000,0:12:27.210
then let's take a look at how we did so

0:12:27.210,0:12:29.710
we should have sears era be our allies

0:12:29.710,0:12:31.590
at zero zero strength

0:12:31.590,0:12:32.509
minutes

0:12:32.509,0:12:34.290
should be fifteen

0:12:34.290,0:12:35.030
and uh...

0:12:35.030,0:12:36.880
fifteen right there

0:12:36.880,0:12:40.540
and our second should be fifty nine

0:12:40.540,0:12:44.820
named over here is her seconds the
contract looks pretty good well are way

0:12:44.820,0:12:46.610
down for sure

0:12:46.610,0:12:50.310
and what we want to do you hear is
actually turn these things and two

0:12:50.310,0:12:55.080
members of their close for a number so
we can say into

0:12:55.080,0:12:57.190
and refusing to purge reasons

0:12:57.190,0:13:02.220
contributed interns

0:13:02.220,0:13:06.030
ok gotta go so if you're right we can
take a string interned commander

0:13:06.030,0:13:09.910
despotic palm mike that's what will be
equal investment

0:13:09.910,0:13:11.290
years ago

0:13:11.290,0:13:14.870
returns there so let's go ahead and
remote in time

0:13:14.870,0:13:17.550
sleeper things come out of numbers

0:13:17.550,0:13:18.640
there we don't

0:13:18.640,0:13:20.370
and we can in jacket

0:13:20.370,0:13:22.740
we can say

0:13:22.740,0:13:25.680
reasonable taylor g_g_ equals

0:13:25.680,0:13:28.770
anti-g_a_t_t_ uh...

0:13:28.770,0:13:32.420
men's

0:13:32.420,0:13:33.239
team

0:13:33.239,0:13:35.089
and we can ask the doctor

0:13:35.089,0:13:37.180
that's right

0:13:37.180,0:13:39.060
and it was going to be an actor

0:13:39.060,0:13:40.630
organized

0:13:40.630,0:13:45.290
let's keep working through this and see
if we can create more fields

0:13:45.290,0:13:50.740
so now we can look at the next field
which is going to be testcase

0:13:50.740,0:13:53.880
three hearings in the uh... latitude

0:13:53.880,0:13:56.160
uh... excellent work on

0:13:56.160,0:13:58.660
one

0:13:58.660,0:14:00.430
and what's the

0:14:00.430,0:14:06.110
we need to take a look at why he calls
in

0:14:06.110,0:14:11.980
let's put this in the case evoked
themselves control x two

0:14:11.980,0:14:15.260
all right uh... we're looking at its
this is an year old

0:14:15.260,0:14:16.990
zero right here

0:14:16.990,0:14:18.360
this field

0:14:18.360,0:14:21.300
warm

0:14:21.300,0:14:25.060
and field

0:14:25.060,0:14:29.690
salutes and fields

0:14:29.690,0:14:31.640
and

0:14:31.640,0:14:36.270
go ahead and just offered an actual say
results

0:14:36.270,0:14:37.710
warning

0:14:37.710,0:14:39.120
quiet

0:14:39.120,0:14:41.960
amoco and alot more this as we figure it
out

0:14:41.960,0:14:44.660
wilson reload

0:14:44.660,0:14:47.540
yang and david shaw

0:14:47.540,0:14:48.830
and

0:14:48.830,0:14:51.580
lets you know why is so why

0:14:51.580,0:14:53.470
got this great number of repair

0:14:53.470,0:14:58.910
so we're getting closer to having are
latitude again

0:14:58.910,0:15:01.880
let's let's go back and figure out we
need to do

0:15:01.880,0:15:05.800
but first we need to do is we need to
split is apart who worry about here is a

0:15:05.800,0:15:09.240
red tape that number guns but the point
three off of it

0:15:09.240,0:15:11.760
as carpenter part of it

0:15:11.760,0:15:13.179
so i will say

0:15:13.179,0:15:14.330
into

0:15:14.330,0:15:16.890
yields animal grab the first two

0:15:16.890,0:15:19.240
so that should get us

0:15:19.240,0:15:20.550
forty-three

0:15:20.550,0:15:23.640
degrees off with um... the latches field

0:15:23.640,0:15:27.700
we will give a trying

0:15:27.700,0:15:28.809
and

0:15:28.809,0:15:32.050
working you or against littering

0:15:32.050,0:15:37.360
pregame now we'll go ahead and paul part
the rest of

0:15:37.360,0:15:38.190
and

0:15:38.190,0:15:42.140
we need to carol second part of that
which is going to be

0:15:42.140,0:15:44.000
their own sourcing

0:15:44.000,0:15:45.570
year-olds

0:15:45.570,0:15:48.880
to local groups you chileans

0:15:48.880,0:15:53.170
king work to was going to be a will
report number has been a castle quicker

0:15:53.170,0:15:55.540
and more

0:15:55.540,0:15:57.839
and since this is metz

0:15:57.839,0:16:02.340
that's more minutes we need to divide by
sixteen

0:16:02.340,0:16:04.980
and let's see how we deal with that

0:16:04.980,0:16:06.820
little reloaded

0:16:06.820,0:16:08.290
and

0:16:08.290,0:16:09.470
there we have

0:16:09.470,0:16:12.690
forty three point one between five team

0:16:12.690,0:16:15.410
looking pretty good now we've got a wife

0:16:15.410,0:16:19.230
now we need to be smart about this we
have north and south we're lucky here

0:16:19.230,0:16:23.640
that one with momentous here where
certain compromise on on what we should

0:16:23.640,0:16:26.850
be good committed with an inaccurate
statement

0:16:26.850,0:16:28.250
fields

0:16:28.250,0:16:30.240
doing

0:16:30.240,0:16:31.830
is salad

0:16:31.830,0:16:33.740
need to make a y

0:16:33.740,0:16:37.460
minus five cindy foote to sign a
document designate the southern

0:16:37.460,0:16:39.250
hemisphere

0:16:39.250,0:16:44.400
also ahead an alternative quickly here
with uh... wants to

0:16:44.400,0:16:49.270
and and the copy from my notes so x
people's intel

0:16:49.270,0:16:50.670
yields

0:16:50.670,0:16:52.230
or

0:16:52.230,0:16:55.640
and then take the first three digit this
time if you look for eight years old

0:16:55.640,0:16:58.220
zero seven zero in our

0:16:58.220,0:17:01.370
decrees while wanting

0:17:01.370,0:17:03.320
plus whoops

0:17:03.320,0:17:06.569
fields

0:17:06.569,0:17:09.480
and reach for the and

0:17:09.480,0:17:12.970
and deprive sixty point

0:17:12.970,0:17:16.419
doesn't place isn't really nice and
quiet but it's

0:17:16.419,0:17:17.470
alternative

0:17:17.470,0:17:18.510
reminder

0:17:18.510,0:17:20.329
como se

0:17:20.329,0:17:21.490
yields

0:17:21.490,0:17:25.660
five henry here we have a watch what we
do you have to say minus because we're

0:17:25.660,0:17:29.690
not the negative hemispherical

0:17:29.690,0:17:31.750
sold say

0:17:31.750,0:17:34.830
equals last

0:17:34.830,0:17:38.010
x equals minus acts

0:17:38.010,0:17:42.230
and results

0:17:42.230,0:17:46.640
school

0:17:46.640,0:17:52.090
was give adequate counsel to reload

0:17:52.090,0:17:55.510
and we have our et cetera why very
nicely

0:17:55.510,0:17:59.320
so it's how do you want to rush it
mostly picking polish the rest of the

0:17:59.320,0:18:01.830
feels real quick with yourselves

0:18:01.830,0:18:03.279
weed

0:18:03.279,0:18:05.240
one more of those will look at

0:18:05.240,0:18:07.799
one of them we want to grab z

0:18:07.799,0:18:10.660
and susie is actually this one right
here

0:18:10.660,0:18:13.419
answer that mission you know

0:18:13.419,0:18:14.770
too

0:18:14.770,0:18:16.610
and for

0:18:16.610,0:18:17.640
five

0:18:17.640,0:18:19.880
six seven

0:18:19.880,0:18:21.690
nahi

0:18:21.690,0:18:25.460
seventeen saying

0:18:25.460,0:18:30.710
uh... fields sub knowing

0:18:30.710,0:18:36.039
will say results

0:18:36.039,0:18:43.020
people knowing and want a purple and
blue or

0:18:43.020,0:18:46.260
mean that looks pretty gains will give
it a shot

0:18:46.260,0:18:47.610
reloaded

0:18:47.610,0:18:51.750
dan ronan and now we have is the uh...
thirty six point six which is this

0:18:51.750,0:18:52.840
number

0:18:52.840,0:18:53.860
right here

0:18:53.860,0:18:55.610
this all those years

0:18:55.610,0:18:56.970
mostly the same

0:18:56.970,0:18:59.730
so now we have a parser

0:18:59.730,0:19:00.650
makeup

0:19:00.650,0:19:03.280
one final control x one

0:19:03.280,0:19:07.529
you know we have a g_g_ along that we
can always use for any particular line

0:19:07.529,0:19:10.690
there's a few more feel that we can do
and in the final notes or put all the

0:19:10.690,0:19:12.310
fields in there

0:19:12.310,0:19:15.640
emory ignore other checks from right now

0:19:15.640,0:19:18.580
uh... in the notes will be on a computer
check some

0:19:18.580,0:19:20.350
and we'll talk a little bit about

0:19:20.350,0:19:22.290
hang my tears with

0:19:22.290,0:19:25.300
shot multiple

0:19:25.300,0:19:26.299
values so

0:19:26.299,0:19:29.190
we're going to go ahead and make an
impartial

0:19:29.190,0:19:30.179
the lyric

0:19:30.179,0:19:34.549
look for the bt g message of growth

0:19:34.549,0:19:40.169
banging heads for the rather worsthorne
lines about someone's of

0:19:40.169,0:19:41.820
are na

0:19:41.820,0:19:43.660
along

0:19:43.660,0:19:46.190
who have the teaching

0:19:46.190,0:19:48.820
and here's our

0:19:48.820,0:19:50.070
slow-motion

0:19:50.070,0:19:53.950
long well actually moving in one action
vessel here but it's a nice message

0:19:53.950,0:19:54.660
tonight

0:19:54.660,0:19:56.230
departs

0:19:56.230,0:20:01.809
so we can say test the jeans equals

0:20:01.809,0:20:06.100
and complete that

0:20:06.100,0:20:09.130
so now we have our next message
indicating dept

0:20:09.130,0:20:11.019
the g_g_ foreperson not

0:20:11.019,0:20:13.919
going

0:20:13.919,0:20:16.549
and this week is going to be

0:20:16.549,0:20:17.720
the parched

0:20:17.720,0:20:18.870
course

0:20:18.870,0:20:19.820
hooper

0:20:19.820,0:20:25.530
ground and ground

0:20:25.530,0:20:28.380
so do the same thing we had before so if

0:20:28.380,0:20:30.530
vpg

0:20:30.530,0:20:32.510
no along

0:20:32.510,0:20:35.299
return knowing

0:20:35.299,0:20:36.380
freakin

0:20:36.380,0:20:41.740
and we can save results equals
interdiction a rehearsal setup returned

0:20:41.740,0:20:44.190
results to last a blankie

0:20:44.190,0:20:46.399
pumping looks

0:20:46.399,0:20:47.750
and the concert

0:20:47.750,0:20:52.510
pushing through tuesday fields equals
wind dot sports

0:20:52.510,0:20:54.290
on common again

0:20:54.290,0:20:56.450
and they can start posting date

0:20:56.450,0:20:59.370
so if we have this position right here

0:20:59.370,0:21:02.440
is going to be warm and that's going to
be are

let's let's make sure it's the aurora

or so

0:21:49.020,0:21:50.770
and we could also do you

repair

0:22:05.270,0:22:09.490

let's go ahead and try it out in seattle
comes out to pick up a box

0:22:28.990,0:22:30.669
will go and say

0:22:30.669,0:22:31.419
are

to get the next calling

0:22:38.670,0:22:39.830
enter

0:22:39.830,0:22:41.780
and will say

uh... g animals and uh... uh...

uh...

0:22:49.170,0:22:51.000
g

0:22:51.000,0:22:52.590
and i'm not

0:22:52.590,0:22:55.120
impacting our back call heading

0:22:55.120,0:23:00.340
and magnetic anna the and collateral
bill clinton

0:23:00.340,0:23:03.740
this is not because i mean this is just
uh... and in fact

0:23:03.740,0:23:08.260
scene from the wonder of the g_p_s_ on
the ways and system

0:23:08.260,0:23:12.799
tonight gives us the functional
equivalent creepy

0:23:12.799,0:23:17.360
function that can loop over all the
final and give us back archana

0:23:17.360,0:23:18.880
uh... so we can

0:23:18.880,0:23:25.380
these things called generators so
creates a generator

0:23:25.380,0:23:27.279
well

0:23:27.279,0:23:30.950
over a bio and basically figure out
which

0:23:30.950,0:23:35.100
warranted compulsion return back to
church for those

0:23:35.100,0:23:36.500
so we can say

0:23:36.500,0:23:38.820
dash horst

0:23:38.820,0:23:41.040
what form

0:23:41.040,0:23:43.549
file and so here were

0:23:43.549,0:23:48.010
take our pieces and put them together so
you have a choice abusing your function

0:23:48.010,0:23:49.090
appear

0:23:49.090,0:23:50.340
deputy chief

0:23:50.340,0:23:53.730
or you can use this generator to walk
away

0:23:53.730,0:23:57.360
when we can say for line in open

0:23:57.360,0:23:59.340
balmain

0:23:59.340,0:24:02.630
then we can say um... yes

0:24:02.630,0:24:04.070
he is

0:24:04.070,0:24:05.770
him wine

0:24:05.770,0:24:09.340
we can do

0:24:09.340,0:24:12.010
gravis function called yield

0:24:12.010,0:24:16.540
and what you'll does it returns back
with medina from that particular country

0:24:16.540,0:24:17.249
in it

0:24:17.249,0:24:21.789
in juneau are forbidden from using the
call this in your seat on the net

0:24:21.789,0:24:24.849
to take my word for it now stands a
yield gta

0:24:24.849,0:24:28.179
lines when they go ahead and of course
balance

0:24:28.179,0:24:29.860
and alice

0:24:29.860,0:24:33.170
the g

0:24:33.170,0:24:35.040
in one

0:24:35.040,0:24:38.799
you

0:24:38.799,0:24:41.680
uh... and g

0:24:41.680,0:24:46.370
i remember that when you're inside of a
module we don't need to refer to you

0:24:46.370,0:24:47.670
uh... functioning

0:24:47.670,0:24:52.360
indebtedness and here you can use use
pgp function worries elsewhere you have

0:24:52.360,0:24:54.549
to say important matter and then

0:24:54.549,0:24:56.730
neema dot vpg

0:24:56.730,0:24:59.760
so let's go ahead and client turn

0:24:59.760,0:25:02.470
tried are will generator here

0:25:02.470,0:25:04.890
and i'll show you know and not

0:25:04.890,0:25:06.990
and little in

0:25:06.990,0:25:08.680
seat at the same time

0:25:08.680,0:25:11.490
so we're gonna reload kearney mo and
module

0:25:11.490,0:25:12.860
which is working

0:25:12.860,0:25:15.420
and we'll go ahead and say for

0:25:15.420,0:25:17.200
message in

0:25:17.200,0:25:18.170
horrors

0:25:18.170,0:25:20.019
not

0:25:20.019,0:25:21.470
final

0:25:21.470,0:25:23.660
and then ponce

0:25:23.660,0:25:26.750
not dot log

0:25:26.750,0:25:30.500
toward god hears her typical poorly
canceled an importer messaging that's

0:25:30.500,0:25:32.240
not supplying

0:25:32.240,0:25:33.680
hands

0:25:33.680,0:25:36.440
well have tremendous impartially match

0:25:36.440,0:25:39.460
violets gonna call this function can
keep calling it

0:25:39.460,0:25:41.570
and move through this file and

0:25:41.570,0:25:42.410
until

0:25:42.410,0:25:44.900
this runs out of date and there

0:25:44.900,0:25:48.370
or something happens batman pricks

0:25:48.370,0:25:50.510
sources say grant

0:25:50.510,0:25:51.580
message

0:25:51.580,0:25:53.840
so hopefully if all goes well we're
going to see it

0:25:53.840,0:25:56.799
budgeted american

0:25:56.799,0:25:59.750
when you go

0:25:59.750,0:26:02.440
and i need to call it the right way

0:26:02.440,0:26:03.720
so here

0:26:03.720,0:26:04.990
encinas

0:26:04.990,0:26:08.660
the module name

0:26:08.660,0:26:12.300
and look at that we have tons of gays in
the master

0:26:12.300,0:26:13.719
still see that

0:26:13.719,0:26:16.100
um...

0:26:16.100,0:26:18.679
there's a lot of g_p_a_'s going by

0:26:18.679,0:26:22.350
and we'll see if we actually handed me
teaching some of their comments and

0:26:22.350,0:26:25.730
south to try it

0:26:25.730,0:26:28.519
you know reloaded

0:26:28.519,0:26:32.140
them all kinds of him

0:26:32.140,0:26:35.790
and there's all are having similar kind
of bearing in mind

0:26:35.790,0:26:38.070
service weighing with our generator

0:26:38.070,0:26:43.129
you can walk through this file and have
it figure out which one is what

0:26:43.129,0:26:45.669
partially return back to the dictionary

0:26:45.669,0:26:50.390
there we could then be where some arya
stumbling a uh... whatever they wanted

0:26:50.390,0:26:52.720
to tucked apply for

0:26:52.720,0:26:55.030
do ever be national budget that we
wanted

0:26:55.030,0:26:57.959
and this guy was much more reusable than
before

0:26:57.959,0:27:00.840
because now we can break also a function
that is

0:27:00.840,0:27:03.090
for example load

0:27:03.090,0:27:05.269
g_g_ aids

0:27:05.269,0:27:06.200
farming

0:27:06.200,0:27:10.640
and if you have the same code we have
the force of the courts

0:27:10.640,0:27:14.310
and this return completed and stimulate
this

0:27:14.310,0:27:16.430
recanted say

0:27:16.430,0:27:17.810
um...

0:27:17.810,0:27:19.870
for warning

0:27:19.870,0:27:20.830
when

0:27:20.830,0:27:24.179
file name

0:27:24.179,0:27:25.320
to you

0:27:25.320,0:27:28.020
warning

0:27:28.020,0:27:29.930
we can say acts

0:27:29.930,0:27:34.610
loves

0:27:34.610,0:27:40.620
was x-men where the let's make it
simpler acts schools want calls

0:27:40.620,0:27:43.159
and if you have that we could use a

0:27:43.159,0:27:46.890
uh... something like season

0:27:46.890,0:27:51.340
seems to me and

0:27:51.340,0:27:52.919
uh... one

0:27:52.919,0:27:59.620
and now i could say textile and messages
um... xd

0:27:59.620,0:28:01.370
that's cool

0:28:01.370,0:28:03.740
we hand

0:28:03.740,0:28:06.009
uh... zero x

0:28:06.009,0:28:10.640
to jumped atop a mother and take a peek
at what we have here said talker

0:28:10.640,0:28:15.070
and he's going to x and y without
someone to kick in

0:28:15.070,0:28:17.530
so far i dot and

0:28:17.530,0:28:20.330
message stuff

0:28:20.330,0:28:23.940
line

0:28:23.940,0:28:29.019
called it an emergency returned x
comment line

0:28:29.019,0:28:33.440
so now we have a much higher functioning
infusing our stuff we have before so you

0:28:33.440,0:28:36.580
just need to know prudential partici
g_-eight

0:28:36.580,0:28:40.039
animal to lose those fields in there

0:28:40.039,0:28:44.970
and that's it for today this will
hopefully give you a sense of trying to

0:28:44.970,0:28:48.900
make it a little bit more module and
this is an actually how i punched me in

0:28:48.900,0:28:52.549
the data in my library they actually
something called regular expressions

0:28:52.549,0:28:54.659
we should give you a sense of

0:28:54.659,0:28:58.580
trying to make things a little more
modular and by doing this with having a

0:28:58.580,0:28:59.440
death

0:28:59.440,0:29:04.279
gta pitches party online you can
resembles a multiple different ways

0:29:04.279,0:29:08.480
indicando potthurst reached a different
aspects that are inside

0:29:08.480,0:29:09.769
are fine

0:29:09.769,0:29:11.459
thank you for joining and i come back
for
