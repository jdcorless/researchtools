* Introduction

These are the caption files for YouTube.  They start off as the
machine transcriptions downloaded from YouTube.  The transripts then
*heavily* edited to get them to be close to what I said.  YouTube's
auto transcription does not work well for technical discussions.

I welcome transcript patches!  I would be especially excited to have
translations into other languages.

These lecture(s) failed the YouTube process and have nothing to start
with:

- Lecture 13
- Lecture 20
